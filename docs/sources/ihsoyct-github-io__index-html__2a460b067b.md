Good in both myself and my partner. She was lacking fat development more than I was and she saw visible increases in a month of usage in both face and breasts. Not dream-result, but significant.

I saw smaller but still perceptible changes. The biggest difference was on the backs of my hands.

We're both trans-feminine and I'm on the chunk side while she's skinny.

I ended up using LotionCrafter as it comes a little bit more finished than AliBaba. Mixed 1ml of Adifyline with 1ml of Vasoline Cocoa Glow (mixing up about 20ml at a time). Applied to face, breasts and any leftovers to backs of hands.

These photos are only about a month apart. The big change is I actually started sticking to my routine instead of once a fortnight.

I also let ChatGPT's research mode pair up skincare products with some of my medications and other goals. It may have been overkill but I actually understand what everything is doing now and have some plans to expand it. It also reminds me morning and night what I need to do :)

The biggest practical change seems to be that my skin is healing and thickening resulting in a more even colour tone.

Morning

* Cleanse with Garnier PureActive
* Adifyline
* The Ordinary Multi-peptides with copper (this is new)
* The Ordinary Hyaluronic acid
* The Ordinary Vitamin C suspension 23% with HA spheres (this is new)
* The Ordinary Niacinamide
* Moisturise with Vasoline Cocoa Glow
* La Roche-Posay Antihelios if I'm going outside or will be in the sun at all

Night

* Cleanse
* Adifyline
* Multi-peptide
* Tretinoin
* Moisturise

I'm planning on getting a Derminator soon, and I'm also thinking about DMSO+Tret for areas of body skin that are too thick to achieve any structural changes.

At some point I'll also try out C60 Buckyballs as they seem to be anti-aging magic or something.

My main peeve at the moment is something the photo didn't manage to capture - there's tiny soft freckles all over my face but they're not distinct enough to be freckles so I just kind of look not washed in the wrong light. Any other suggestions on how to handle that?

>I'll be retesting with the tret soon so that's that covered.

You can't "test" this stuff any more than you already have. Either you commit to using it for the required period to actually see a difference or don't bother I guess. You won't see decent results until you've used it for a couple of years consistently.

>The adifyline I'll test on the cheeks and may be around the forehead then see how it's going.

That isn't how that works either unfortunately. Your face will absorb it and it'll put the fat where your genetics said you should have had it as a teenager. The good news is that's everywhere that makes you look healthy and young.

Now we're talking.

How long ago did you lose the weight? This looks like classic ozempic (or any other rapid weight loss) face. It takes a couple of years but your skin will tighten up in certain ways. Tret helps that happen faster (skin cell cycling + adds a ton of fresh collagen and elastin).

For the rest, you can definitely look at adifyline to cover some bases as well.

As I've said a few times, no single thing is the entire solution, but each thing gets you noticeably closer. As long as you're not expecting magic, it can happen.

As you're a cis man, I'd also probably add a weak estrogen topical cream to that, but you need to be *very* careful here, as yes, misuse or not understanding dosages can cause breast buds to develop and not just softer skin. r/drwillpowers has mentioned his personal concoction a few times, and you can buy your own Estradiol Valerate from grey-market sites and carefully make your own lotion.

My weight moved around rather than losing any. Estrogen definitely helped in that regard, and it's known for seeming to wind back age a bit, but it's not nearly as effective in that regard as adifyline, with the main bonus being adifyline doesn't make you become a woman if you're a cis-gendered man.

There's about ten major factors in everyone's age appearance rather than just one or two.

I'm just hitting that age where I *should* be showing signs of aging and I've carefully addressed all of the sub-issues. Estrogen is just one of the things I had available to me.

Given that adifyline is relatively cheap, and topical (so it's easy and non-invasive to use) and *fast* I'd always say try that for a couple of months first.

I mean, time matters. Start everything you should be doing NOW.

Tret is the minimum, so it's good you're doing it, but there are other options you can try too.

In the end, men age with a fair amount of dignity and you seem to be doing really well. I don't see any real negatives going on here, but if you MUST look young, search reddit or my post history for Adifyline.

My experience has been that if you already have estrogen in your system, this won't really help much.

I have heard of men using a weak estradiol face cream to some effect, but if you have any amount of estrogen in you at all you're probably already getting the full benefit of it.

It's a little new, but look into acetyl hexapeptide-38 (also known as adifyline) as a topical treatment for what you're trying to do. I used my hands to apply it to my face and after about a month both showed pretty good improvement. This peptide likes to stimulate fat rejuvenation in places that juvenile humans normally only have it, and it winds the clock back pretty good in some aspects like sagging and overall wrinkling from slack skin.

Lotioncrafter sell it. I mix it with 1 pump of moisturiser to every 1ml of serum and apply the same amount to each region I'm treating morning and night (apparently it also causes breast plumping so I use it there as well). 

On their site it's called adifyline. I searched around for clinical studies and only found one.
