<h1>Looks like the stop-and-go is also """endorsed""" (read: plagiarized without attribution) by Powers now!</h1>
<p><strong>r/estrogel</strong> • by u/darthemofan • 16 points</p>
<div class='post-content'><div class="md"><p>Look at <a href="/r/DrWillPowers/comments/jj55qj/patients_from_germany/gac4o9f/">/r/DrWillPowers/comments/jj55qj/patients_from_germany/gac4o9f/</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Without knowing a lot of details here, I can tell you that what I would probably do is pull you off hormones entirely. I would do a system reset. Just let your body reset itself and then start over with estradiol orally and bicalutamide. That's typically what I do for patients in your situation</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hmm, stopping hormones for a while to do a system reset? I wonder where he got the idea from? /s</p>
<p>But wait, it gets better. You know how recently we adjusted the length to 2 weeks?</p>
<p>From <a href="/r/DrWillPowers/comments/jj55qj/patients_from_germany/gadd7uu/">/r/DrWillPowers/comments/jj55qj/patients_from_germany/gadd7uu/</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don't take people off for months. Just like a week or two.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As for the adrenal hypothesis we are now working on?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some hidden androgen that your adrenal glands are making That is inhibiting breast development.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have a crystal ball that told me that we we refine the andrenal protocol and drug regimen to spiro and/or dxm <a href="/r/estrogel/comments/jfehly/proposed_protocol_for_high_tdht_or_signs_of/">/r/estrogel/comments/jfehly/proposed_protocol_for_high_tdht_or_signs_of/</a> and figure a safe dose, they will suddenly be endorsed by powers too :)</p>
<p>TBH, I couldn't care less about plagiarism without attribution. It's a fact of life, it's how things generally work online.</p>
<p>What I have a problem with, is when a for-profit-doctor who's running huge banners on their youtube <del>commercials</del> Q and A (not even FFS surgeons dare do that!!) makes $ERIOU$ BU$INE$$ (700 person waitlist... <a href="/r/DrWillPowers/comments/jgvfaw/the_waiting_list_finally_starts_moving_on_monday/">r/DrWillPowers/comments/jgvfaw/the_waiting_list_finally_starts_moving_on_monday/</a>) on methods taken straight from the community, while pretending otherwise <a href="/r/estrogel/comments/jcxpw2/there_is_no_such_thing_as_powers_dht_mutants_just/g95vjbg/">/r/estrogel/comments/jcxpw2/there_is_no_such_thing_as_powers_dht_mutants_just/g95vjbg/</a> and dissing alternatives, like calling safe penetration enhancer "illicit" <a href="https://youtu.be/k4X5XVcdvqA?t=4673">https://youtu.be/k4X5XVcdvqA?t=4673</a> and instead promoting unsafe tricks straight from the drug user community <a href="/r/researchchemicals/comments/aiz7k8/using_dmso_as_a_roa/">/r/researchchemicals/comments/aiz7k8/using_dmso_as_a_roa/</a> like using 10% DMSO <a href="/r/DrWillPowers/wiki/compounded-medicines">/r/DrWillPowers/wiki/compounded-medicines</a> </p>
<p>And what a class act: charging $300 extra every year on top of the consultation fee for uninsured out-of-state patients, then bitching about having to answer patients questions (most doctors do that and don't complain), while pinpointing one very special case of a demanding patient as if it was normal <a href="/r/DrWillPowers/comments/jjw57s/this_is_why_there_is_a_300_out_of_state_fee/">/r/DrWillPowers/comments/jjw57s/this_is_why_there_is_a_300_out_of_state_fee/</a>  ... omg omg omg</p>
<p>People making money is good. People nickel and diming the trans community, based on the despair borne from the abysmal incompetence of most doctors is bad.</p>
<p>And it doesn't stop there. It comes with unforeseeable consequences. Like pushing Boron did lead some people to try to eat Borax <a href="/r/DrWillPowers/comments/hpzfve/alternatives_to_boron_there_is_none_in_my_country/fxux9xe/">/r/DrWillPowers/comments/hpzfve/alternatives_to_boron_there_is_none_in_my_country/fxux9xe/</a> instead of using safer methods to help with their transition!!!</p>
<p>Even if I have a very wild imagination, I would have never guessed that one day, people would try to eat soap to get better HRT results, and suggest others to do the same, and I would need to tell someone "do not eat soap" not as part of a jole, but in a dead serious tone... So now I'm worried that this """endorsement""" will lead people to try equally stupid things...</p>
<p>Please don't improvise. Keep it simple. What we believe atm is that 2 weeks may be enough: <a href="/r/estrogel/comments/j7f5oi/resuming_stalled_growth_with_the_stopandgo_how/">/r/estrogel/comments/j7f5oi/resuming_stalled_growth_with_the_stopandgo_how/</a></p>
<p>Before, I was suggesting 1 months, as I did that and got results. Some people like <a href="/u/gillian12334">/u/gillian12334</a> did a 3 months stop and also experience extra fat redistribution <a href="/r/estrogel/comments/jexvqu/another_confirmation_of_results_from_the/ga5hbca/">/r/estrogel/comments/jexvqu/another_confirmation_of_results_from_the/ga5hbca/</a>?context=3 - something I didn't get with just 1 month. We are still working on to improve the method, but we will not disclose early results in a "fake leak" <a href="/r/DrWillPowers/comments/h8yn21/early_leak_of_some_v_70_powerpoint_changes_the/">/r/DrWillPowers/comments/h8yn21/early_leak_of_some_v_70_powerpoint_changes_the/</a>  until we can confirm them. This is because we accept the risks that come with self experimenting, as we are voluntary guinea pigs. But you should never be.</p>
<p>So people, plz be safe. And remember the only person that will have to support the consequences of what is "prescribed" to you to people with medical degree will be... you. Inform yourself. Knowledge is more than half the battle. Knowledge is power.</p>
<p>BTW, about DMSO, even in the very moot wikipedia you find some warnings (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimethyl_sulfoxide#Toxicity:">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimethyl_sulfoxide#Toxicity:</a> "DMSO exposure to developing mouse brains can produce brain degeneration. This neurotoxicity could be detected at doses as low as 0.3 mL/kg, a level exceeded in children exposed to DMSO during bone marrow transplant").</p>
<p>They are further supported by relatively little and barely known medical journals (/s) like Nature (!!) and PLOS one (!!) cf <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0107447">https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0107447</a> <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/1705883/">https://www.nature.com/articles/1705883/</a> and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/1703848">https://www.nature.com/articles/1703848</a> ; even if it talks about IV DMSO: "we suggest that there is a need for reassessment of the toxicity of 10% DMSO and detailed re-evaluation of the use of a lesser dose"</p>
<p>If you consider the 0.3 mL/kg neurotoxicity level, quick math says that all a 130 lbs/60kg person needs .3*60=1.8 milliliter ... in a 10% serum like powers suggest, use 18 ml of said serum, and you may be at risk... check out someday how little 18ml is :(</p>
<p>Please consider what Powers call our "illicit" methods, like Niaouili Oil (mtf) or Menthol (ftm)...</p>

<p>I don't really know about your case here, just wanted to cry about it because 1. Doesn't surprise me 2. Kinda horrified by how little access there is to trans healthcare that his fans back him like what he says is written in stone when he just treats people like trash so often.</p>
<p>Thanks for all the work yall do on here though. I'd be lost in the sauce without these subs.</p>

<p>nothing really. At first like a lot of ppl I though he could be reasoned with. Now I only see him as someone who's bound to cause serious harm to various people and the community itself</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>yeah they're cringy. I rarely do, but after a very vicous PM I said to one of them I didn't want to hear of them anymore for whatever reason.</p>
<p>Anyway thanks for your encouragements, we're always happy to help. Try to pass it forward any way you can!</p>
