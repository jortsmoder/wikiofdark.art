<h1>30 Days of Retatrutide</h1>
<html><body><div><div><p id="block0">I've had trouble maintaining my weight since high school. If I eat "normally", I slowly gain weight, and if I eat nothing but <a class="LinkStyles-link" href="/posts/bSTFqJ7rxZJu3oG89/lazy-hasselback-pommes-anna">a specific potato casserole</a>, I slowly lose weight.</p><p id="block1">Recently, I hit a new high-record weight and decided it was finally time to do something more serious about it, so for the last month I've been taking the standard CICO diet advice. I finally realized that I should eat healthier, and eat significantly less. I work out slightly more. I cut out most high-fat foods and became strict about not eating after 6 pm.</p><p id="block2">Anyway, this is a post about my experience with retatrutide.</p><p id="block3"><i>This is not a how-to article, so I'm not going to talk about where to get peptides or how to safely use them. See </i><span><span><a href="https://www.cremieux.xyz/p/how-to-get-cheap-ozempic"><i>this article</i></a></span></span><i> if you're into that sort of thing.</i></p><h1 id="The_Experiment">The Experiment</h1><p id="block4">Retatrutide is a GLP-1 agonist similar to semaglutide (Ozempic), but which seems to cause more rapid <span class="InlineReactHoverableHighlight-highlight"><span></span>weight less</span>.</p><p id="block5">It isn't FDA-approved yet, but you can buy it for experimental purposes. I forgot to pre-register my experiment, but my hypothesis was that if I took 2 mg of retatrutide per week, I would lose weight.</p><p id="block6">I also failed to register this experiment with an IRB. My doctor told me that losing weight would improve several of my health conditions, but GLP-1 drugs are only indicated with a BMI 0.5 units higher. The standard of care is to not treat the underlying condition and to instead take a fistful of drugs every morning.</p><p id="block7">So, I guess my experiment was highly unethical. Luckily it was privately funded and the subject is unlikely to sue me.</p><figure class="image image_resized"><img alt="Obi Wan saying &quot;Well, of course I know him.

It was a daily occurrence for about a week, and then became something that only seems to happen when I exercise really hard, eat late, or drink alcohol. I try to eat my last meal of the day around 5 pm so I have plenty of time to digest before bed, but 30 days in I can eat at normal times if I have to.</p><p id="block22">If I did this again, I would take omeprazole for the first week, then the morning after each injection for the second week.</p><p id="block23"><i>Note: You should not take omeprazole longer than 14 days since your body adapts to it.</i></p><h2 id="Heart_Rate">Heart Rate</h2><p id="block24">The most <span><span><a href="https://x.com/cremieuxrecueil/status/1960464334355882243">concerning</a></span></span> side effect was my resting heart rate jumping up and my heart rate variability dropping.
