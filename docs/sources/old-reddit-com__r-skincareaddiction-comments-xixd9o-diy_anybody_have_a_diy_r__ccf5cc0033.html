<h1>[DIY] Anybody have a DIY recipe for Cellulite cream? Or know a cheap compounding pharmacy? I want the cream to use on droopy old face ...</h1>
<p><strong>r/SkincareAddiction</strong> • by u/brasscup • 0 points</p>
<div class='post-content'><div class="md"><p>Amazon products don't cut it and are absurdly expensive per fluid oz. Back in the 90s when they first started saying aminophylline cream reduced the appearance of cellulite, I lived in NYC and a friend would go to a compounding pharmacy where she had an existing relationship. </p>
<p>They made her a basic cold cream type mix with a minimum of 3.5 per cent aminophylline as per clinical trials at a cost of $100 per 16 oz jar -- all of us in the office kept buying it for as long as we worked there... the results were incredible. Forget about cellulite -- not only was it smoother looking but the skin on our legs and butts was infant soft after a few weeks of use. Now I'm a gazillion years old, much poorer and longing for something similarly effective that I could afford for my droopy face.</p>
<p>The lower part of my face and under jaw is where the fat from my cheeks seems to have sunk. I know nothing but surgery will address the sagging skin -- I don't care. Were the sag less poufy I would still look just as old but I might be able to recover the angular lines of my long narrow face (I was never particularly pretty but I was striking).</p>
<p>I've fooled around in the kitchen a bit with my blender stick and microwave.</p>
<p>I bought a huge jar of aminophylline tablets without a prescription from a foreign pharmacy a couple years back and made cream from them but tablets contain excipients and fillers -- it just wasn't the same. The fillers made it more difficult for absorption.</p>
<p>More recently I made a cream using a ton of theobromine which is similar to caffeine in terms of skin care. I rather like it but again, it is nothing near as good as what the compounding pharmacy mixed up into those one pound jars (its not like there were special extra ingredients in there either -- the other ingredients were mineral oil, glycerin, urea, etc.)</p>
<p>Any ideas for DIY? Or does anyone here have a very reasonable compounding pharmacy they use that ships out of state?</p>
<p>I have been sick for the last few years, unable to work. Being old is a great disadvantage now that I am back on the market again and if possible, I would love my face to come across as an interesting wreck rather than just podgy</p>

                <div class="md"><p>There isn't even a legit cellulite cream made by any company, you're definitely not gonna solve it by mixing things up in your kitchen.</p>
