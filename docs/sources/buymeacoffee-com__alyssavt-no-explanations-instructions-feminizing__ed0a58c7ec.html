Your ascents and descents should be as smooth and controlled as a pendulum's swing.</p><p><a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/alyssavt/how-i-manage-training-time" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Quick instruction on training sessions:</a><br/>They should be no shorter than 5 minutes and no longer than 10 minutes. These short sessions should be spaced a minimum of two hours apart. Three of these sessions per day seems to be optimal, but is not required. If you're having trouble training, aim for one 5-minute session to keep the training habit alive. If you're feeling great and want to train a bunch, go for five sessions, so long as they're still spaced out as above.</p><p><em><u>Phase 2 - Building Strength:<br/></u></em>For the next 2-3 weeks, until you can push much farther towards your target resonance than before, and hold it for longer.</p><p><strong>MANDATORY NOTES ON STRAIN:<br/></strong>We will be pushing our limits, so we will run into strain. Strain should be avoided, but running into it isn't the end of the world. <strong>If you experience pain or difficulty breathing in any form, immediately stop what you're doing.</strong> Try it once more without straining, if you're able to then great, move on. <strong>If you're not able to do it without straining, ask for help. </strong>If strain becomes a habit, it can lead to long lasting or permanent damage to your voice.</p><p>Learn the Voiceless "eh" exercise: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yiVvIZXsHdHyC8yZijpyws-mrn4xEXw0/view?usp=sharing" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">audio recording</a><br/>Replace the Voiceless "puh" with the Voiceless "eh" in our exercises.</p><blockquote><p>Homework:</p><p><strong><u>Goals<br/></u></strong>1. Build muscle strength with our core exercises.<br/>2. Gently push your limits at the top.<br/></p><p><strong><u>Exercises<br/></u></strong>3x BDLD (Big Dog Little Dog) up and hold (10 seconds)<br/>3x voiceless "eh" up and hold (10 seconds)<br/><br/>Repeat until 5-10 minutes has passed<br/>Aim for three 5-10 minute sessions a day, spaced out by a few hours each</p></blockquote><p>"Up and hold" refers to getting to your highest resonance, pushing a little higher, then holding there until time runs out or the muscles begin to burn. Ideally, we hold until just before the muscles start to burn, then drop and rest. <strong>Do not hold your muscles high into the burn, they're too small to handle it and you may strain them.</strong></p><p><br/>Start with a Voiceless "eh" and get to as high a resonance as you can. Try to hold that resonance as you add voice and begin to speak a few sentences from whatever you can read around you. Odds are, you lost most of your resonance switching from the Voiceless "eh" and that's completely normal. Being able to convert your voiceless resonance into voiced resonance is a skill, and it will get better as we practice.</p><p>For 2-3 weeks, until switching to voice is much easier.</p><blockquote><p>Homework:</p><p><strong><u>Goals<br/></u></strong>1.

For as many guides as you may read, you're not an expert in voice and there are just some things that take experience to know and understand. These same things can be quite literally impossible or completely impractical to try and describe in something as simple as a guide. Issues that persist beyond this point need hands on training with a coach.</p><p>I tried to cover everything I could, in as little detail as possible while still getting the job done. Hopefully, it was helpful!</p><p>Happy training!</p></div></div></body></html>
