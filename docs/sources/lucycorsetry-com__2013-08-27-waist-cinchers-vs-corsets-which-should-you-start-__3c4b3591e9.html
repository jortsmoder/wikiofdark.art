<p><span>In the past month or so, I’ve received the same question from over a dozen people: “Should I start with a waist cincher before buying a corset?”</span></p>
<p><span>This causes a lot of confusion, because two different markets are both referring to two completely different garments as “waist cinchers”. Within the corsetry community, “waist cinchers” are still genuine corsets – but simply shorter than a full underbust corset. Essentially, what I consider a cincher is simply a particularly short underbust corset.</span></p>
<p><span>However, within a certain market, it seems that “waist cincher” has become synonymous with latex/rubber elastic fajas that only reduce your waist 1-2 inches, and are designed to not <a href="https://lucycorsetry.com/2012/01/12/corsets-and-skin-issues/" target="_blank" title="Corsets and Skin issues">let your skin breathe</a>, overheat your body and make you sweat to reduce water retention. Below the video break, I’ve made a comparison chart between a <em>genuine corset</em> “waist cincher”, the<em> other elastic</em> “waist cincher”, and a full underbust corset:</span></p>

<p><span>It’s important to note that calling a corset a “cincher” vs “underbust” depends on the person, whether you are the corsetiere or the client. A short corset that is advertised as a “cincher” by a certain brand, may fit like a full underbust corset on a client with a particularly short torso. Corsets that are between 8″ – 10″ on the side seam I often consider to be a grey area, because depending on your height and torso length, it may fit either like a cincher or a full underbust corset.</span></p>
<h4><span>Who can wear corset cinchers?</span></h4>
<p><span>I recommend corset cinchers to people who are short of stature or who have a short torso (because full underbust corsets on the market are often too long, which pushes up the breasts unnaturally and/or may dig into the lap when sitting down). Someone of average to longer waist may also enjoy a cincher because it provides more mobility and less rib contouring than a full underbust.</span></p>
<h4><span>Which companies sell genuine Corset Cinchers?</span></h4>
<p><span>I’m glad you asked! I have a whole gallery dedicated to <a href="https://lucycorsetry.com/research-corset-brands/guided-galleries/curvy-cinchers-under-200/" target="_blank" title="Curvy cinchers and waspies under $200">Cinchers for $200 or Less</a>.</span></p>
<h4><span>Are Latex/ Rubber Cinchers good to start with, to get me used to corsets later?</span></h4>
<p><span>Truthfully, I think a latex cincher and a genuine corset feel totally different. The few weak bones in the latex cincher don’t support it enough, and if they are plastic then they can warp and poke into me. The fabrics ends up wrinkling and bunching into rolls, making my figure look worse. I also find the non-breathable, sweaty, grippy, itchy fabric almost unbearable. Although a genuine corset is more rigid and can be bulkier with more layers, I find it more breathable, more comfortable and much more effective at giving a dramatic waist reduction. If you’re looking for a starter corset to test out <a href="https://lucycorsetry.com/2013/10/13/waist-training-vs-tight-lacing-whats-the-difference/" target="_blank" title="Waist Training vs Tight Lacing – what’s the difference?">tightlacing</a>, <em>go for a corset cincher</em> that doesn’t come up as high on the ribcage. This will allow the ribcage to expand more freely, will give you more mobility, and may be able to hide under your clothing more easily compared with a full underbust or an overbust corset.</span></p>

Longer than a cincher corset.</figcaption></figure>
<h4><span>Which is more cost-effective, a Latex Cincher or a Corset Cincher?</span></h4>
<p><span>Many people buy a latex cincher because it seems to be a cheaper/smaller investment (around $40 for some brands, as opposed to $75-$100 for an entry-level corset). But even a not-so-great OTR corset may still give you useful experience in corseting, and can help you reach a 4″ reduction in your waist, </span><a href="https://lucycorsetry.com/2012/11/23/otr-and-bespoke-industries-support-one-another/" target="_blank" title="OTR and Bespoke industries support one another">even if it falls apart within a month or two</a><span>. By contrast, a latex cincher may cost less but also won’t give you as much <a href="https://lucycorsetry.com/before-after/" target="_blank" title="Before / After Waist Training">waist training progress</a>, won’t give you useful experience to see if you want to continue waist training, and will also not last forever, as latex can stretch out and dry-rot over time.</span></p>
<h4><span>You really hate rubber cinchers, huh?</span></h4>
<p><span>They might suit some people. If you want to keep a small waist reduction at night but you’re claustrophobic about sleeping in a genuine corset, then an elastic cincher may be a better option. Likewise, you’re not supposed to exercise in a genuine corset, so perhaps wearing a latex cincher would be better then (only if you insist on wearing one for exercise; I don’t). But if you are genuinely interested in <a href="https://lucycorsetry.com/2013/10/13/waist-training-vs-tight-lacing-whats-the-difference/" target="_blank" title="Waist Training vs Tight Lacing – what’s the difference?">tightlacing or waist training</a>, I would encourage you to <a href="https://lucycorsetry.com/2013/08/02/another-day-another-dollar-is-that-corset-worth-it/" target="_blank" title="Another Day, Another Dollar – is that corset worth it?">save your money</a></span> <span>and buy a worthwhile authentic corset.</span></p>
