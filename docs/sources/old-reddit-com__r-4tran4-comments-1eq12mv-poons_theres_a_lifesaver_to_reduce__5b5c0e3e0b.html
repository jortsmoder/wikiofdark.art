<h1>Poons, there's a lifesaver to reduce your ass, thighs, and love handles</h1>
<p><strong>r/4tran4</strong> • by u/Lopsided_Bar2863 • 58 points</p>
<div class='post-content'><div class="md"><p>The way these parts of my body currently are, makes me want to rope, if they don't change to have a more masculine fat distribution visibly too after a few years of effort I will rope, but I'm still new on t, and fat, so it's not completely over for now as long as I put in effort, and I have been researching ways to make the lower half of my body more masculine. I will share this knowledge with the other poons.</p>
<p>Your body has a2 receptors, which tell it to store fat in areas where these receptors are most active and numerous.  Estrogen tells the a2 receptors to be more active, and increases their amount. Areas of your body with more, and more active a2 receptors store the fat there, unfortunately those who are estrogen dominant, store them in the ass thighs and love handles the most, and estrogen makes these receptors more active.</p>
<p>Inhibiting the A2 repetor, or inhibition of phosphodiesterase as well, but I won't go into how this works, on that area of fat, would help that area stop storing fat and store it elsewhere. This could be done through a topical cream that inhibits the a2 receptor on a localized area of the body, or blocks phosphodiesterase there, or reduces availability of cortisol at fat cells themselves since cortisol helps store fat, or a cream that can do all of the above.</p>
<p>Aminophylline which is a bronchodilator helps inhibit a2, and glycyrrhetinic acid helps reduce availability of cortisol at fat cells. Aminiphylline 2% can be found in celluthin cream or since now celluthin is difficult to find, amilean lotion, and glycyrrhetinic acid can be found in atopiclair cream which is primarily used for dermatitis.</p>
<p>Using Atopiclair 3 times daily, and amilean two times daily, trying to wait 1 hour in between applying one and the other just to be safe, but still applying both morning noon and night will produce results, apply it to the areas with which you want to spot reduce, and ideally be on a caloric deficit at the same time. Apply multiple times a day since it's a cream as bioavailable as other medicine so it needs more often application.</p>
<p>Info from an old blog about biohacking here <a href="https://tim.blog/2011/01/16/spot-reduction-revisited-removing-stubborn-thigh-fat/">https://tim.blog/2011/01/16/spot-reduction-revisited-removing-stubborn-thigh-fat/</a></p>
<p>Oh and for true getting the most out of fat redistribution on t specifically, you have to lose fat and gain fat, your body doesn't redistribute fat that efficiently when it's not changing much. Do this over and over until fat distro is satisfactory, aka big cutting phase and big bulking face like bodybuilders say. Dr Powers sub also has info on using dht cream with t injections to masculinize further, which I am researching at the moment as well.</p>
<p>Oh, and since there are a lot of terf lurkers reading this, to all the no hrt reppoons, you can use this to redistribute fat to be more masculine in distribution even if you're not on t, though t is a must have to get full results and masculinize.</p>
<p>EDIT: Amilean has 2% aminophylline for those who struggle to find celluthin.</p>

                <div class="md"><p>pioglitazone, a medication that you take for 3-6 months once to redistribute where your fat deposits are located from visceral fat (under the skin in your tummy) to subcutaneous fat (thighs, ass, boobs, anywhere else under the skin). <a href="https://grayoasis.com/post/3">there's a blog on the grayoasis website</a></p>
<p>It's also not something you take permanently, but the fat changes have a permanent effect. Because it uses bone marrow stem cells to make new fat cells in your body and thus if you take it too long your bones get all brittle. There are other side effects too AFAIK but yeah.</p>
<p>Pioglitazone is also not recommended for anamaxxers, you gotta fatmaxx while taking it to get the best results.</p>
<p>anyway that's about all I've learnt abt it, i could be wrong on some things but it's handy. I wish I could see timeline photos on pio because I wanna know how much of an effect it has lol</p>

<p>It also can lead to some negative long term side effects (discussed in section 3), so it is advised to not go past a year of continuous use and to keep lifetime exposure minimal. Therefore, I’d only recommend using it while intentionally gaining weight, and only for a maximum of 6 months to a year at a time.</p>

                <div class="md"><p>Now that I think of it, perhaps you can use it on the undereye area, and the brow ridge area to encourage fat storage there, giving you a more masculine 'hunter eye' look as fat storage in these areas gives the eyes a narrower, more square hooded look.</p>
<p>Adipeau cream could work for fat accumulation purposes too. </p>
