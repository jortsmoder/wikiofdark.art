<h1>Advanced Breaking in your Corset (Intuitive Seasoning)</h1>
<html><body><div><div class="entry-content single-page">
<p>This serves as a synopsis to my corset seasoning mini series from 2013, but also an addendum for experienced corset wearers and how they break in their corsets as well. Feel free to watch the video from 2014 above, or read the post (a transcript, revised in 2016) below.</p>
<p><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HGcG-k37hvA">VIDEO</iframe></p>
<p>There are understandably some complaints from people about the 2-2-2 guidelines and how this doesn’t work for people who wear corsets at a 6, 7, or 8+ inch waist reduction. This is a valid point and I want to share with you the same thing that I told to these more extreme tightlacers back in 2014.</p>
<p>Romantasy’s 2-2-2 guideline (wearing the corset at a 2-inch reduction [measured over the corset, so it is actually a <a href="https://lucycorsetry.com/2013/03/26/measuring-your-internal-true-corseted-waist/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">slightly more dramatic reduction under the corset</a>], for a duration of 2 hours a day, each day for 2 weeks) is exactly that: <strong>a guideline for beginners.</strong> You can choose to follow it or not follow it.</p>
<p>Some 7 or 8 years ago, before I ever read about the Romantasy method, some other corset companies posted instructions online for beginners, telling customers to <em>“lace the corset as tight as you possibly can, and keep it on for as long as you can stand it”</em> on the first wear – and more alarmingly, to <em>“expect that it will hurt”</em> until you can force the corset to soften and mold to your body.</p>
<h1><span>Holy crap, that is bad advice.</span></h1>
<p>Luckily I had the sense to not tie my corsets as tightly as possible from the first wear, but I did observe that for the first couple of corsets I owned, when I had not broken them in gently, one of my corsets ripped at the seam when I sneezed, another corset had a busk break through the center front seam, and yet another had a grommet pull out within 2 wears – at this time I believed that I was lacing too tightly/ too fast, or treated my corsets too roughly.</p>
<p><em>I will add a note here though: if you read through my <a href="https://lucycorsetry.com/category/corset-seasoning-mini-series/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">seasoning mini-series</a>, you’ll see that even when you treat a professionally-made, custom-fit corset quite gently, <a href="https://lucycorsetry.com/2013/04/26/6th-corset-seasoning-a-tear-in-the-seam/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sometimes SNAFUs can still occur</a>. It was only after a different corsetiere came forward a year later and noted a ripped seam in a green corset her own company had made, that it was hypothesized that this particular batch and color of green Gütermann thread might have been defective and not as strong as their usual thread!</em></p>
<p>The 2-2-2 guideline was designed to <strong>combat the incorrect and potentially dangerous information</strong> that was previously distributed by other brands [to wear your corset as tight as possible on the first wear]. The Romantasy method helps the gently ease the beginner’s body into the process of wearing a corset (because most people are so accustomed to elastic, loose fabrics today that such a rigid garment such as a corset may take some getting used to). The process of “seasoning your body” is just as much (if not more) important than the softening process of the corset itself – making sure the fibers are aligning and settling properly (if the corset is on-grain), and observing the corset losing its ‘crispness’ so it may hug around your body better.</p>
<p><strong>It’s already implied that a beginner would not be starting with an 8-10 inch reduction</strong> that would fit on them like a wobbly corset with only the waistline touching your body. Although a small amount of flaring at the top and bottom edges is normal if your corset is not closed in the back, to experience flaring so extreme that you can fit stuffed animals into your corset, I believe the corset is probably too curvy for you if you’re a beginner. Refer back to my article about <a href="https://lucycorsetry.com/2014/04/09/how-much-to-size-down-and-why-too-wide-corset-gaps-are-bad/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">corset fitting, and why having a gap too wide in the back of the corset is a bad thing</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>At the time these guidelines were created, achieving more than 4-6 inches of reduction was extremely rare.</h3>
<p>Back in the 1990s to early-2000s, when I was researching corsets as a teenager, many authorities and corset makers were only recommending that people start with a 3-4 inch reduction – maybe 6 inches if you were plus size or particularly compressible. Think of the OTR corset brands that existed 10-15 years ago: Axfords, Vollers, Corsets-UK, Timeless Trends – these corset vendors did <em>not</em> make extremely curvy corsets designed for dramatic reductions at the time, and <strong>the average person would be lucky to achieve more than a 3-4 inch waist reduction without their ribs and hips getting compressed too tightly anyway.</strong> Over the past 5 years, curvier corsets have become more accessible through OTR brands (as opposed to having to commission a custom piece at 3-5x the price of OTR). Today I’m hearing of people buying their <em>first</em> OTR corset at 8 or even 10 inches smaller than their natural waistline, which is <em>not</em> a practice I would condone for everyone.</p>
<p>I can wear a corset around a 7-inch reduction, but I’ve been wearing corsets occasionally for around 12 years, and waist training off and on in the past 6 years. My waist has become accustomed to the pressure such that my muscles readily stretch, my intestines readily flatten and give way, and my body can accommodate moderate-to-largish reductions relatively quickly. But this may not be the case for a beginner, and there is such a thing as going down too much, too quickly. My concern is that if a beginner is starting with a corset 8-10 inches smaller than their natural waist, <a href="https://lucycorsetry.com/2014/04/09/how-much-to-size-down-and-why-too-wide-corset-gaps-are-bad/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">their corset will not fit properly because they may not tolerate large reductions in the beginning</a>, but they may be impatient and want to close the corset within a few weeks or months. I don’t want people to end up hurting themselves.</p>
<p><strong>Regardless, nobody is holding a gun to your head and forcing you to season your corset using the 2-2-2 method.</strong> I mentioned in <a href="https://lucycorsetry.com/2013/04/23/2nd-day-of-corset-seasoning/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">one episode of my corset seasoning mini-series</a> that different methods and durations of breaking in your corset exists, and there is no “One” perfect way, no one hard and fast set of rules to break in your corset.</p>
<p>Romantasy has one way of doing it, Orchard Corset has a different method, Contour Corsets has yet a different method, and I’m certain that there are other brands who have their own way. Some methods are faster, some are slower, some methods are more structured, some are very free. <strong>The common goal is to have a corset that wraps around your body like a glove, and feels comfortable enough to wear for long durations without injury to yourself. </strong>But it’s also imperative that you start with a corset with a reduction suited to your experience level and body type, and with <a href="https://lucycorsetry.com/2014/02/27/using-measurements-to-predict-the-fit-of-otr-corsets-online/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">dimensions predicted to fit you well</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Different people have different bodies, and can cinch to varying reductions.</h3>
<p>Someone who is larger, more squishy or more experienced might be able to cinch down more than 2 inches on the first wear (indeed, one of my clients whose natural waistline approaches 50 inches is able to close a corset 12 inches smaller within a few wears! Same with someone who has had surgeries to remove their colon earlier in life, but this is an extreme situation obviously not applicable to 99% of the population).</p>
<p>However, some other people are very lean, or they are body builders and have a lot of muscle tone, or they may simply have inflexible obliques or inflexible ribs, or they have a low tolerance to compression, and they may not be able to reduce their waist by even 2 inches – and <strong>those who are naturally able to lace to dramatic reductions should not shame those that can’t.</strong> Also by having a general guideline for beginners, and a modest one at that, it can help eliminate a false sense of competition between inexperienced lacers who have not yet learned to listen to their bodies.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Viewer question:</p>
<p><em>“I’m wearing the corset as tight as I possibly can, and it measures the same on the outside of the corset as my natural waist? What am I doing wrong?”</em> The answer: <span>nothing is wrong</span>. Firstly, your corset has some bulk, so even though your external corseted measurement is the same as your natural waist, most likely <a href="https://lucycorsetry.com/2013/03/26/measuring-your-internal-true-corseted-waist/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">your internal waist measures 1.5 – 2 inches smaller</a>. And if that’s as small as you can comfortably go at this time, and if your corset is fitting you properly (it’s not a case of the ribs/hips of the corset being too small for your body and blocking your waist from reducing more), that reduction is perfectly fine! <strong>Wearing a corset should be enjoyable, not a cause of stress.</strong> With patience, most people find they can comfortably reduce more in several weeks or months.</p>
<p>Another question I regularly receive:</p>
<p><em>“How long does it take to season a corset?”</em> Different corset makers will state that it takes different amounts of time for their corset to be fully broken in, just like I mentioned in <a href="https://lucycorsetry.com/2013/04/23/2nd-day-of-corset-seasoning/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a previous episode of the mini-series</a>. <span>Orchard Corset once said that it takes around 10 hours to season, while Contour Corsets says to take closer to 100+ hours</span> to season one of her <a href="https://lucycorsetry.com/2013/06/03/contour-corsets-review-summer-mesh-underbust/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hardcore summer mesh tightlacing corsets</a> – so there is a spectrum, and it depends on the brand, materials and construction methods.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Some people like rules, others don’t.</h3>
<p>The whole point of Romantasy’s 2-2-2 guidelines is to encourage beginners to ease into the process of wearing the corset and to be gentle with themselves from the start. What I’ve found over the years is that <strong>some people are more intuitive and like to learn from experience</strong> – they prefer to navigate their own way through a new skill/ process through trial and error, <strong>while some others are more analytical and prefer to have a more rigid system</strong> that they can follow. This is true for more than just corsetry – it’s true for learning to play a new instrument (classical vs contemporary lessons, or even having a teacher at all vs being self-taught) or losing weight (some prefer to just eat well and walk more often, while others take on a strict workout regime with a certain number of reps with certain weights, and they count calories and macromolecules, etc.). Most people are somewhere in between. Most importantly, both methods have their perks and drawbacks, and <strong>one method is not inherently better than the other.</strong></p>
<p>Perhaps it’s a certain type of person who is drawn to corsets in the first place, but I notice a larger proportion of my viewers and readers prefer to have some rules or guidelines to start out with. It’s okay to follow a system until you become familiar with your body and you can come to trust your own experience. <strong>It’s okay to “learn rules” and then choose to accept or reject them later on.</strong></p>
<p>And of course, some people naturally possess more common sense than others (I cringe when someone tells me that their ill-fitting, poor quality corset bruised them and yet they refuse to stop wearing it!).</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Let guidelines guide you, not control you.</h3>
<p>There are some beginners who are very pedantic and they begin to worry that they seasoned their corset at 2.5 inches instead of only 2 inches – of course, there is a limit to everything and it’s not that big a deal if you don’t follow the guideline to the letter. However, if you wore your corset for 12 hours on the first day and ended up bruising yourself, this is a greater concern (and you should always place more importance on your body than on your corset – a corset may cost $50 – $300 on average, but your body is priceless and irreplaceable). A 2(ish)-hour guideline should be long enough for you to tell whether your corset is causing any fitting issues (or is contraindicated with any pre-existing condition, like if a corset tends to bring on a headache or blood pressure spikes to those already prone), while usually being short enough in duration that it shouldn’t cause bruising or pinched nerves or any other troubles that could arise.</p>
<p>Obviously, corsets should <em>never ever</em> hurt, pinch, or bruise you, nor should it cause muscle tension, or headaches, or exacerbate your health problems – if it does, that type of corset is not right for you, or you may not be healthy enough to wear a corset.</p>
<p>These days, I have a very intuitive way of wearing my corsets <em>after</em> they’re broken in – I don’t necessarily count the hours I wear them, or the reduction. If the corset feels too loose, I might lace it a bit more snug. If the corset feels too tight, I will loosen it. If I’m sick of it, I take it off! (By the way, you can learn more about <a href="https://lucycorsetry.com/2014/05/30/how-to-waist-train-comparing-corset-training-methods/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">different waist training methods in this article</a>.)</p>
<p>When you’re more experienced with corsets, you can trust yourself to be more intuitive regarding how long to wear the corset and how tightly.</p>
<h5>Analogy: Hard Contact Lenses</h5>
<p>I started wearing hard contact lenses at 14 years old. They correct my astigmatism by literally acting like a brace for my eyeball and changing the shape of my cornea. While soft contacts mold to the natural shape of the eye, hard contacts will encourage the eye to take the shape of the contact lens (similar to how a corset molds your waist). But this can cause eye irritation especially in the beginning – my corneas were not adapted to the shape of the contact lens, so I couldn’t wear my contacts 14-16 hours a day. The optometrist gave me a strict schedule to follow, starting with wearing the contacts for 2-3 hours a day, one or two times each day, and slowly building up from there. The schedule lasted about 3 weeks until I was able to wear my contacts all day without eye strain, nausea, headaches, eye dryness, or irritation. Of course, when I get a new pair of contact lenses (with a stronger prescription, booo but such is life), I don’t have to go through the exact same schedule because my eyeballs are already accustomed to wearing contacts – I only have to get used to the strength of the prescription. When receiving a new corset (with a silhouette you’re already accustomed to), you don’t have to “re-season” your body the same way you did as a beginner, but you may need to train your body if your new corset is a few inches smaller than you’re used to.</p>
<h5>Analogy: Weight Lifting</h5>
<p>Some people will go to a personal trainer for a few weeks or months to learn good form and to get help with finding the weight, number of reps in a set and number of sets in a workout – and then once they know what they’re doing, they can stop going to the trainer and adapt their own workouts the way they like. Over time, you can expect to improve your strength and you may be able to lift more weight or go for more reps – but the program you make for yourself over time may not be suitable for a different person, especially not a beginner. On another note: other experienced athletes prefer to keep going to a personal trainer for years, long after they already know how to perform certain exercises properly and know intuitively what works for their own body, because these folks find value in having someone else create a system for them and continue to hold them accountable (which is also likely why Romantasy’s 3-month waist training coaching service has been successful over the years).</p>
<h3>What is Lucy’s excuse for still seasoning all her corsets the same way?</h3>
<p>I’ve been wearing corsets for over a decade and have seasoned well over 100 corsets in that time. Why do I still follow a structured seasoning schedule, especially as an intuitive corseter after the seasoning process?</p>
<p>The reason for this is mainly because I prefer to season all of my corsets in the same method. I do regular reviews with different corset brands. By controlling the reduction and the duration I wear every corset and giving them all the same treatment prior to review, I can see how well some corsets stand up to tension over time. In truth, I can tell within 10 minutes of putting a new corset on whether that corset is going to work with my body or not. Quite honestly, there have been certain corsets where (had I not received a request to review the corset) I would have tried on that corset once and immediately gotten rid of it. But if I’m going to give a fair review, I have to give a corset fair treatment.</p>
<p>In science, you have to control as many variables as possible in order to perform a fair, objective experiment. <strong>So I’ve incorporated a quality control system where I control as many variables as best as possible</strong> by seasoning every corset the same way. This ensures that I’m not putting more stress on some corsets than others (the exception to this being a ‘rental’ or ‘loaned’ corset that I need to send back after filming, in which case I won’t season it at all). The 2-2-2 guidelines are, as mentioned before, a very mild amount of stress to put on a corset – and if that corset does not even survive a trial period of 30-50 hours without seams stretching or a grommet pulling out, <strong>then I <em>definitely</em> know that the construction is compromised and the quality isn’t close to what I’d consider industry standard</strong>.</p>
<p>Bottom line, if you are an experienced corset wearer, or if you are particularly compressible, or if you hate following a rigid schedule, then the 2-2-2 guidelines (or indeed, any other corset seasoning guidelines) may very well not work for you, and that’s alright. But other people find it more comfortable follow a more rigid seasoning schedule. It’s really no skin off your back to let someone break in their corsets in a different way, as long as the other person is not hurting themselves and not destroying property. Live and let live.</p>
