<h1>A patient for whom I make a custom compound that worked very well for his vaginismus asked that I post about it here.</h1>
<p><strong>r/vaginismus</strong> • by u/Drwillpowers • 39 points</p>
<div class='post-content'><div class="md"><p>Hi there! I'm Dr. Powers, I'm a family physician in Detroit MI. </p>
<p>I mostly treat transgender patients, and as a result, I treat many transgender men, some who struggle sometimes with Vaginismus. </p>
<p>I developed a few compounded drugs for them that really seem to help, and my patient wanted me to list them here. This is a compound that helped him with significant pain with penetration, and after using it for awhile, he no longer finds it necessary. <strong>These are not things that I sell</strong>. These are <strong>just the formulae</strong>. Your own doctor can <strong>write a prescription to a local compounding pharmacy</strong> for them. </p>
<p><strong>Dr Powers Vaginismus Cream-  Nitroglycerin 0.1%+Diltiazem 2% + Diazepam 1%  SIG: Apply 1 gram to vaginal introitus 10 minutes before sexual activity. (Can be placed deeper if necessary via an application rod like those used for BV/yeast treatment if needed).</strong> </p>
<p>I adapt the compound to different patients, some patients don't need all 3 ingredients, but the nitroglycerin works basically like topical "poppers". Some patients need that one removed if they get a headache from it. It causes the smooth muscles of the vagina to relax. Diltiazem is a calcium channel blocker that improves blood flow and relaxes muscles as well, and diazepam is valium, which is another solid muscle relaxant. </p>
<p>The three of them together work synergistically and make the opening of the vagina go pretty limp and relaxed. </p>
<p>I also do make a product for anorgasmia which sometimes patients with vaginismus also have. </p>
<p><strong>Dr Powers Scream Cream V2.0  Aminophylline 30 mg/mL, Ergoloid Mesylate 0.5 mg/mL, Pentoxifylline 50 mg/mL, Sildenafil Citrate 10 mg/mL, L-Arginine 60 mg/mL 30 mL Pump  Apply 1/2 ml to clitoris 15 minutes before intercourse</strong> </p>
<p>Again, I cannot provide these for you and you cannot buy them anywhere online. These are just formulas, but they work really well for my patients, and you could ask your doctor for a prescription to give to a local compounding pharmacy to have them made for you if your doctor thinks they would be medically appropriate and safe for your individual health. I can't tell you if they would be safe for you or not (the main risk with the compounds is lowered blood pressure, and some people require lower doses of the constituent medications to not get side effects). </p>
<p>I hope I haven't offended anyone or broken any rules by posting this, but I just wanted to do what my patient asked me to do and share this info here as it was helpful for them.  Feel free to remove my post or whatever if its not appropriate for this community.</p>
