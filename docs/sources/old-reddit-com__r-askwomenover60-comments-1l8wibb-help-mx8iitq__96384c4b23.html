                <div class="md"><p>To me, your legs look fine. If you are self-conscious, that Sally Hanson AirBrush Legs is supercheap (I have had the same can for like three years) and it is water resistant.</p>
<p>I don't actually us it on my legs but it's the only face makeup I've used for the last ten years. I put a blob of lotion or moisturizer in my palm and spray some of this into it and rub it over my face.</p>
<p>Instant completely translucent tan that looks completely natural (nothing like self-tanner). it is great on days when you didn't get enough sleep the night before or are feeling peaky. My skin's pretty good from a lifetime of Retin A use but when I use this stuff, nonstop compliments on my skin-tone.</p>
<p>Unless you are spraying it on directly, even if you are very fair, buy the Deep Glow Shade because you can dilute as you see fit by adding  more moisturizer. It stays on forever mixed with lotion, doesn't settle in fine creases or emphasize flakiness (which is a concern for me as I've pretty much nonstop used Retin A since I was in my teens).</p>
<p>Here is the Walmart listing, two cans of deep glow color for $19.94 (you can probably by them single in the store): <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/seort/10322901">https://www.walmart.com/ip/seort/10322901</a> Amazon has it too but $15.91 for one can is super high price. (I still have my Prime account because I get it half price but very nearly boycotting Amazon).  That said, the can lasts super long if you spray it into a hand full of moisturizer instead of spraying it directly on your body. </p>
<p>I only use this stuff on my face and neck because I am perfectly fine, at 67, with my legs looking shaggy -- it is expected. But, I can make one more recommendation if your gams really bother you.</p>
<p>Back in the 90s when I worked for newspapers, a friend in the office lived near a compound pharmacy and had them mix up 16 oz tubs of 3% (or maybe 4%) aminophylline cream. (It's the asthma medication that was used in thigh creams of the era).</p>
<p>Anyway, the percentage used matched the percentage employed in clinical trials.</p>
<p>And this stuff worked! Within a few weeks, completely changed the texture of our butts and thighs to baby smooth.</p>
<p>(Unlike the ready made stuff which came in three or four ounce tubes and should have worked if aminophylline was present in the quantity claimed on the label, but it didn't work.</p>
<p>In any event, none of the aminophylline containing thigh creams on the market today are full strength and regulatory agencies have even fewer teeth so I wouldn't waste my money trying them.</p>
<p>But ... if you want to give it a try, find a a compound pharmacy and get a quote for how much they'd charge for a pound of basic white cream with 4% aminophylline in it.</p>
<p>(In the 90s, NYC, it was $100 for a one-pound jar but considering it was big enough to last six months it wasn't a horrible deal).</p>
<p>And if you find a good compound pharmacy, please report back and let us know!</p>
<p>Note: if it works, you will absolutely notice. It is not like a lot of supplements and topicals in the sense that the difference is super-obvious. You don't have to surmise whether you are getting a placebo effect to justify expenditure.</p>
<p>I am much broker now then I was then -- plus I have packed it in, perhaps permanently, in terms of dating -- but I would nevertheless consider a purchase like this if I met a great woman (definitely done with men, no offense intended).</p>
<p>Never been one of those women who claims she wears makeup, high heels, hair coloring etc. "for myself." For me, for being among friends and family, I don't give a damn.</p>
<p>But I can frame grooming in my own mind as a kind of "mating ritual" -- I mean, I have always hated perfumes, no matter how fine, but if a partner is super into scent and it it makes her more eager, I learn to cope.</p>
<p>PS: OP, you realize that you shot your legs from an angle nobody but you will ever view! Guarantee you will like them infinitely better if you check yourself out in full length mirror in full sunlight.</p>
