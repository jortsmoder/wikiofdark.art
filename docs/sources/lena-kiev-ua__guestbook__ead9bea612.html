i am a pre op male to female transexual i have recently started taking female
hormones what i would like to know is at what point should i start to feel
that i am making progress toward my goal of becominng what i really want tobe
a woman i made some progess  as  i have  began to develop breasts i have gone
from being flat chested to a size 38b i was tickled pink getting my first
training braand i was like a giddy schoolgirl filling a larger size bra i
just love and adore my soon to be 38c breeasts and my goal is to be a 38d cup
i wont realy feel that i made progress until that ugly piece of meat betwen
my legs is cutoffi have been telling friends and family that i can wait to
get my hole put in i plan on having my sexchange operatiom overseas in europe
also have been saying that i cant wait to go abroad and come back a broadi
just simply love it that my breasts bounce swing and jiggle even when i am
wearing a good support bra<br/>
<font><i>Lena:</i> If you are concerned only with breasts and
genitals then you make a clown out of yourself. Until you <b>complete</b>
facial electrolysis, most people will consider you a man in a dress regardless
of any size breasts, what is between your legs, clothing and makeup.
Only after you complete facial electrolysis (takes about 2 years), you'll make
a real progress toward your goal.
Despite deceptive advertising, laser and flash-lamp (IPL) hair removal removes
hair for longer time than plucking but for no more than 1-24 months
(usually 2-6 months) after last session, no matter how many sessions.
The only really permanent method of facial hair removal is needle
electrolysis. Professional electrolysis costs about $20K. You can do it
by yourself for free. Several members of the
Russian-language T* mailing list I run cleared their faces by Do-It-Yourself
electrolysis at home. No device needed at all. How to:
<p>
I got the idea and some tips from Bernadette (docfont@) on the
unfortunately terminated since then TSDoItYourelfers mailing list,
I devised even more DIYish :) details.
Bernadette did it with "Inverness One Touch" device (about $30)
which consists from 9V battery, variable resistor as current regulator
and a buzzer (on a simple digital IC) just for convenient count of time.
The main thing is that it's neither flash, thermolysis nor blend,
but plain galvanic method, i.e. pure DC, a simple electrochemical process:
part of water molecules in the body is dissociated to H+ ion (proton)
and OH- ion, an electron from the needle joins with the H+ ion
resulting in hydrogen atom, two hydrogen atoms join into hydrogen molecule,
hydrogen gas bubbles out (too little of it to inflame), OH- ions (i.e. lye)
remain near the needle (mostly where resistance in lower, i.e. along
blood vessels), erode follicle and fuse the vessels. Unlike other
methods of needle electrolysis, galvanic forgives small misses,
less likely damages skin and gives much higher probability of
successful killing the follicle on the first try, i.e. way less regrowth.
Galvanic <b>seems</b> slower (almost a minute per follicle, though really
it's not slower considering less regrowth) and low-tech, but the real
reason why pure galvanic is almost never used by professional
electrologists is that devices for it are too simple and therefore
unprofitable for device makers and sellers, so they brainwash
electrologists. Impatient customers add to that and as a result
endure much more pain. Galvanic not just gives least regrowth and
least risk of skin damage and equipment is cheapest, galvanic is
also far less painful.
Bernadette improved the device by increasing voltage of the battery
(AC/DC adapter is <b>absolutely not</b> suitable!  not just because of
safety rules, but because AC power supplies not only 50 or 60 Hz,
but also harmonics and receives radio-frequencies, they easily
pass through transformers no matter how much electronics
and cause unnecessary pain, skin irritation, twitches; they also
smelt tissue during inserting driving the needle past the target),
but used the same second electrode - a small metallic plate at a side
of the needle holder touching it after inserting the needle,
but the touching disturbs needle placement.
No such devices here, so I devised another, more convenient way:
no device at all. A 9V battery, a cheap ammeter (about $7 if new),
three wires (two of them come with the ammeter), a needle in a DIY
pen-like holder and a stainless steel spoon (or shovel for serving cake)
as second electrode, that's all, no switch (important), no variable
resistor, no electronics (though I do know how, my hobby was
amateur electronics, my speciality in college was electronics,
I worked as a computer technician etc.). In this case the simpler the better,
resist the temptation to make improvements. If you haven't an ammeter
able to measure current up to 1 mA (milliampere) then buy a cheap Chinese
pocket-sized digital multimeter, for example on eBay (search for
"pocket digital multimeter", in the search results choose "Sort by:" -
"Price + Shipping: lowest first", about $7 with free shipping worldwide,
looking about like <a href="../multimeter.jpg" target="link">this</a>,
if same then use the bottom two sockets, at the beginning of each session
rotate the center switch clockwise for 4 clicks to the 2000 position - then
current strength is shown as integer number in microAmperes;
at the end of each session turn the switch back to the OFF position).
Plus of the battery to the
spoon, it's very important, else you'll give yourself permanent tattoo
with rust. Minus of the battery to the ammeter, the probe at the end of
another wire from the ammeter is good as a needle holder: put a 1 cm long
piece of shrink-wrap plastic tube 3-4 mm in diameter onto the bare metal tip
of the probe at the end of the wire, insert the thicker part of the needle
into the same tube, heat the tube with hot air above a small flame,
the tube tightens and holds the needle.
<br/>As usual, facial hair must be grown
for 3-5 mm above skin surface; before and after each session
disinfect face, fingers and instruments with alcohol. Sit before a
magnifying mirror (about 10 cm between face and mirror) with
good lighting with a lamp directly to the face (it's essential),
place a clock with seconds near the mirror, put the spoon down onto the floor.
Pluck a couple hairs with tweezers in order to see how deep follicles are
and remember how much force you have to apply.
Slid/insert the needle along a hair until the needle reaches the follicle,
don't pierce a new hole in the skin. Usually you feel resistance when needle
reaches the follicle, it's enough deep. Needle can pierce follicle - it's
admissible, but don't push needle more than 2-3 mm deeper than follicle.
After insertion of the needle, hold it in place and then (not sooner!)
step by a bare foot on the spoon completing the circuit.
Unimportant visible effect: the lye reacts with skin oil making a little
soap, the hydrogen gas makes foam from it, a little white foam bubbles up
along the needle. Unlike if a switch is used (abrupt change of current),
the surface of contact between the foot and the spoon increases
gradually preventing painful jerk. Adjust current strength
(by surface of the contact between foot and spoon and strength of
pressing on the spoon) so that after 30-40 seconds of current
the hair can be pulled out with tweezers effortlessly without resistance
(unlike plucking), it's a sign that the follicle was killed.
A hitch (like when plucking) means a miss or insufficient charge,
the hair with regrow.
Current strength in microAmperes multiplied to time of passing the current
in seconds is called "charge" in microCoulombs. Quantity of lye produced
with the current is directly proportional to charge.
The charge per hair must be below 20 thousand microCoulombs,
else skin is damaged (small scars and indentations forever).
If 20 thousand microCoulombs = 20 milliCoulombs is not enough
for easy sliding the hair out then that means that you miss the target,
more precision is needed.
<br/>First 10-20 hours will be difficult, but you'll master hitting
the invisible target, it's not rocket science, others managed.
Suitable training place is front surface of the chin, but not in the
pit at the center just below the bottom lip (a relatively painful place,
as well as mustache, especially along the lip and just under the nose,
but still bearable without anesthetic; other places are practically
painless). Don't try to train on the body because hairs there
are thinner and grow at an acute angle to skin surface, much more
difficult to insert needle along. Next treated hair must be
at least 3 mm from previous, don't treat every hair in succession,
skip, else over-treated skin can be damaged. After first 20-30 hours
(training), treat all mustache (skipping) at each session
because hair there are most viable and numerous. Don't move needle
when current is flowing because with current the needle easily
melts skin through anywhere past the target. You'll bend needle,
especially at first - don't throw it away, unbend with another
pair of tweezers with the ends covered with soft plastic tubes.
After many bendings-unbendings a needle breaks, then take another needle.
Pain during inserting usually is a sign of a miss - the needle
pierced pore surface and went past the target. With the galvanic method
skin usually doesn't need special care except dis-infecting with
alcohol before and after each session. Try to avoid water on
treated areas for 3 days if you can. If you can't then
don't wipe the skin, let it to dry by itself. In case of scabs
(like after a scratch, just small and round) don't tear scabs off,
let them to fall off by themselves in order to prevent scars.
The second electrode (a spoon, shovel or a plate under a foot) must be
stainless steel, not aluminium. Copper is less preferable because stains skin.
Ready-made needles can be bought where electrologists buy them.
For the beginning 0.004" (0.1 mm) diameter needles (sometimes called "size 4")
seem optimal.
Needle tip shape is important. A good (probably the best) manufacturer
is Ballet, google search for:
<br/>
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Ballet+needles%22+OR+%22Ballet+electrolysis%22" target="link">"Ballet needles" OR "Ballet electrolysis"</a><br/>
Some other manufacturers are <a href="http://sterex.com/Products/Needles.aspx" target="link">Sterex</a>, <a href="http://WYCneedles.com/" target="link">WYC</a>.
As last resort an about 0.1 mm diameter wire made from stainless steel,
tungsten or nichrome can be used instead of ready-made needle.
Or wires from some dead incandescent lamps - not those conducting current
to the spiral, but thinner wires welded into the glass rod at the center
buttressing the spiral. Or from some small wire loops
(often included into sewing needle sets) used for easy inserting
a thread into a needle eye. Copper wire is unsuitable instead of a needle
because too pliant. Ready-made needles are way better than a piece of wire.
