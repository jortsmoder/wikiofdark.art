<h1>Waist Training vs Tight Lacing - what’s the difference?</h1>
<html><body><div><div class="entry-content single-page">
<p><span>In a previous article, I mentioned that close to half the emails I receive are from people wanting to know <a href="https://lucycorsetry.com/2013/09/24/best-corset-brand/" target="_blank" title="What is the BEST corset for tight lacing/ waist training?">what is the<em> “best”</em> corset for waist training or tight lacing</a> – but today I want to touch on the topic of waist training vs tight lacing (or tightlacing or tight lacing) because it’s very important to know that they are not synonymous, and the definitions vary depending on the source.</span></p>
<p><br/>
<span>Some corset companies use the terms interchangeably, which can be confusing or possibly even dangerous because saying that a corset is designed for “waist training”, a client may come along with an entirely different idea of what “waist training” really is, and may end up using the corset in a way that it was not designed for. So when a corset company (especially an OTR company) claims it to be appropriate for waist training, be very careful about how they define the terms waist training vs tight lacing <em>before</em> you decide to invest. Email them and ask them to get more specific, if possible.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGLRTfMTU4" target="_blank" title="Book Review: Corset Magic">I have talked about the book Corset Magic before</a><span> (written by Ann Grogan, owner of Romantasy – <a href="http://romantasyweb.com/Merchant2/merchant.mv?Screen=PROD&amp;Product_Code=book01&amp;Category_Code=moc" target="_blank">you can find the book here</a>). The book is primarily about waist training, but there is an entire chapter featuring different people’s arguments about what is and what is not considered proper “tight lacing”. After 3 years, I still refer beginners to this manual because it is a wealth of information.</span></p>
<p><span>It seems that many people find it difficult to come to a consensus about what “tight lacing” is and what “waist training” is. I’ve talked about this with other lacers, other trainers/trainees, other corseters/corsetees (as different people also define themselves by different terms) to try and come up with a definition that everyone can agree with. So far, this has been rather unsuccessful – but I will explain the definitions of tight lacing and waist training as I have come to understand them:</span></p>
<h2><span>WHAT IS TIGHTLACING?</span></h2>
<ul>
<li><span><span>Some people say that tight lacing is anything beyond a <span>4 inch reduction</span>. This may be challenging if you have a natural 24″ waist, but easy if you have a 40″ waist.</span></span>

I waist train primarily to achieve a certain tight laced reduction.</figcaption></figure></li>
<li><span>Others say that tightlacing is anything more than <span>20% reduction</span>, which would obviously be different if you are starting from a different size. This would be the equivalent of a person with a 24″ waist lacing down to about 19″, while the person with the 40″ natural waist being able to lace down to 32″.</span></li>
<li><span>Still others say that tight lacing is arbitrary and dependent on the individual’s personal squishiness, tolerance to restriction, etc. Therefore two people with the same starting waist may each cinch down to a different point, they may have a different apparent hip spring, etc. but as long as they are laced to the point where it is a ‘challenging’ (but not painful) reduction, each may be considered a tight lacer in their own right.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>At the time that I’m writing this, own views of tightlacing hover somewhere between the second and third points. In my own experience, I can differentiate between “lightly laced” (feels like nothing) “moderately laced” (snug), “tight laced” (challenging but not painful) and then “over laced” (which is where you may begin to feel unwell or in pain – in this case, you have pushed yourself too hard and I’d advise not getting to this point for any reason, not even to “test yourself”).</span></p>
<p><span>Nevertheless, almost everyone I’ve talked to seem to agree that<span> tightlacing is something that can be done “once in awhile”</span> – for photo shoots, performances, special events etc. In the case of waist training, this is not something that can only be done “once in awhile”.</span></p>
<h2><span>WHAT IS WAIST TRAINING?</span></h2>
<p><span>Just like weight training, voice training or marathon training, waist training is something that you work at over time. It involves a certain intention, end goal, consistent work and dedication.</span></p>
<h4><span>I can’t lace down by 4 inches. Can I still be called a waist trainer?</span></h4>
<p><span>If you are just starting out with waist training and you cannot tolerate high reductions, then you can still <span>call it waist training if you want</span>. Some people wear their corsets all day, every day at a 2-3 inch reduction, which to most lacers would likely not be classified as “tightlacing”. But I know a few individuals who have actually noticed a difference in themselves while lightly laced if they consistently do this for 6 months or more. If you’re petite with a natural 22″ waist and you can’t lace down that much – or even if you’re larger but you just can’t tolerate a lot of pressure – but you are dedicated and try to wear your corset on a near-daily basis, don’t let anybody tell you “that’s not waist training”. Like I said, definitions vary depending on the source.</span></p>
<p><span>If you can tightlace, and you do so every day (even if you only do it because you enjoy it and don’t have particular goals), some might be consider this to be waist training as well. You can be a tightlacer without waist training, and you can waist train without being a tightlacer (to a point). But many people are both at the same time, if they can achieve high reductions for long durations on a daily basis.</span></p>
<h4><span>Why do people waist train? (What are their goals?)</span></h4>
<ul>
<li><span>Some people waist train so that they will be able to <span>tightlace to a certain reduction</span> – so if I want to close my 20″ corsets, I have to train to get there.</span></li>
<li><span>Many other people waist train with the intention of <span>making their natural waist smaller</span> even when they’re not wearing the corset.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>I would argue that the vast majority of people who contact me about waist training fall into this category, so lot of the time I use this definition of waist training (if only because it’s by popular vote):</span></p>
<h3><span>Waist training (corset training): achieving moderate to high reductions in a corset for long durations (months or years) with the intention reducing one’s natural, uncorseted waist – whether by indirect means (e.g. weight loss), or by direct means (e.g. altering muscle, ribcage and/or fat-pad morphology).</span></h3>
<p><span> </span></p>
<h4><span>Is it possible to “accidentally” waist train (reduce your natural waist without intention)?</span></h4>
<p><span>Yes, it’s possible – I know some people who wear a corset every day for medical purposes (e.g. to relieve back spasms, or to provide bust support) and many have experienced that their natural waist measurement reduces over time. Some of these have been delighted at the “unexpected perk” to wearing corsets, but several others have been annoyed or upset by this development. Continually purchasing smaller and smaller corsets is not something everyone can afford, so sizing down can occasionally be unwanted. This individual may not consider this “waist training” as they used the corset for another reason entirely, but some others might consider it “accidental” waist training.</span></p>
<p><span>HOWEVER – other people may consider this a “happy accident” to train their natural waist down. In one sense, this is what happened to me. I used to have corseting goals of making my natural waist smaller – and getting back down to a natural waist somewhere around 24 inches, which was where I was at when I was around 20 – 21 years old (at that time, my waist was achieved with diet/ exercise, not with corsets).</span><span> </span><span>These days, I don’t have the same goal of having a natural 24″ waist. The main purpose for my waist training was to be able to close my size 20″ corsets – <span>I was <em>waist training</em> to achieve a <em>tightlacing</em> goal</span>, and as I got closer to that goal, my natural waist dropped from 28-29 inches down to about 26.5 – 27 inches – and it would stay that way for 24 hours or more after taking off my corset. (However, if I stopped maintaining that reduction for weeks, my waist would begin to expand again). Having a naturally smaller waist was a waist training bonus for me, even though it wasn’t my primary goal.</span></p>
<h2><span> What corset should I look for if I want to Tight Lace?</span></h2>
<p><span>If someone asks me what kind of corset is appropriate for tightlacing, I presume they mean something that is:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>strong enough that it’s not going to rip the first couple times you wear it</span></li>
<li><span>gives a noticeable waist reduction and shaping, because it’s not elastic,</span></li>
<li><span>has steel bones, not plastic bones that easily warp, and</span></li>
<li><span>has a hip spring and rib spring that is wide enough that the corset will effectively cinch in the waist without squishing or pinching everything else.</span></li>
<li><span>A tightlacing corset may be either custom fit or standard size.</span></li>

<p><span>If someone asks me what corset is appropriate for waist training, I presume that they will be using the corset on a daily or almost daily basis, likely for long hours and eventually at high reductions. If you intend to waist train, <span><strong><em><span>GO CUSTOM FIT</span></em></strong></span>. Even if you have rather “standard” measurements, a custom fit piece is almost always more comfortable. Many corsetieres will construct specific “waist training” corsets. Some of the differences I’ve observed with “waist training” corsets vs regular or “tight lacing” corsets amongst corsetieres:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>waist training corsets may have higher quality and stronger materials like coutil or special corsetry broche (whereas tightlacing corsets may be made only from twill)</span></li>
<li><span>waist training corsets may be constructed with stronger seams or they may feature triple or even quadruple stitching (tightlacing corsets may have double stitching but that’s it)</span></li>
<li><span>waist training corsets sometimes have more bones, but more importantly the boning may be interspersed in such a way that it helps avoid giving the wearer pressure points. (Please note that just because a corset is double boned on the seams, doesn’t automatically means that it is suitable for waist training.)</span></li>
<li><span>waist training corsets usually have a smooth interior to prevent wrinkling or abrasion (tightlacing corsets are sometimes constructed with internal boning channels, which I find least comfortable of all construction methods)</span></li>
<li><span>waist training corsets may feature a reinforced busk/ extra wide busk, modesty panel, stronger laces and other upgrades to make your lacing experience more comfortable (tightlacing corsets may or may not include these. Please note that even for waist training corsets, some of these features may need to be purchased or requested)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>All this makes a waist training corset not only <strong>more comfortable</strong>, which means you will be able to lace tighter and longer in comfort, but<strong> it also lasts longer</strong> without falling apart and overall, it’s <strong>more effective</strong> at molding your body and will be <strong>a more positive experience</strong>. You save time, you save money, and you save yourself from discomfort and frustration by choosing a higher quality corset that is made for the job you’re giving it.</span></p>
<h4><span><span>THE BIG QUESTION:</span> is it possible to waist train in an OTR, tight lacing corset?</span></h4>
<p><span>It’s <em>possible</em>. You may see progress, but it might not be as comfortable compared to a waist training corset. Depending on the brand, your corset may break or stretch significantly after a few months because it wasn’t designed to take daily rigorous use.</span></p>
<p><span>Like I’ve said in many Youtube videos and blog posts before, an OTR corset is something that you can test the waters with and see if corseting is for you. If you are tight lacing on an occasional basis or wearing it for temporary shaping and fashion, OTR corsets are fine. But after the first OTR corset, if you want to cinch down past the advised 4-6 inches and continue sizing down in corsets, it would be worth your while (and probably your wallet) to get a well-made, properly fit corset that will hold up to the tension you put on it and last you a long time. </span></p>
<p><span>If you see an OTR corset company that boasts up to 6-8 inches reduction and says they’re appropriate for waist training, and especially if they make no distinction between tight lacing and waist training, proceed with caution. Educate yourself as much as possible before investing in a corset – your body deserves the best.</span></p>
