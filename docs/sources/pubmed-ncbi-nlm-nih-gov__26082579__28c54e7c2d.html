<h1>Efficacy of Slimming Cream Containing 3.5% Water-Soluble Caffeine and Xanthenes for the Treatment of Cellulite: Clinical Study and Literature Review</h1>
<html><body><div><div class="abstract-content selected" id="eng-abstract">
<p>
<strong class="sub-title">
          Background:
        </strong>
      
      Cellulite is a 'cottage cheese-like' cutaneous change caused by subcutaneous fat bulging into the dermis that usually leads to cosmetic problems. Slimming cream containing 3.5% water-soluble caffeine and xanthenes exhibits a lipolytic effect with penetration into the dermis.
    </p>
<p>
<strong class="sub-title">
          Objective:
        </strong>
      
      To evaluate the efficacy and safety of slimming cream for the treatment of cellulite.
    </p>
<p>
<strong class="sub-title">
          Methods:
        </strong>
      
      Fifteen subjects with cellulite applied slimming cream to the thighs and inner side of the upper arms twice daily for 6 weeks. Efficacy was assessed using a standard visual scale, changes in the circumferences of the thighs and upper arms, and patient satisfaction by a questionnaire at baseline, week 3, and week 6. Safety was assessed by inquiring about adverse events through questionnaires.
    </p>
<p>
<strong class="sub-title">
          Results:
        </strong>
      
      The standard visual scale score improved significantly by 0.49 points (19.8%) at week 6. Thigh and upper-arm circumferences decreased by 0.7 cm (1.7%) and 0.8 cm (2.3%), respectively, at week 6. Slight itching and transient flushing were commonly reported, but no serious adverse event occurred.
    </p>
<p>
<strong class="sub-title">
          Conclusion:
        </strong>
      
      The slimming cream tested appears to be effective for the treatment of cellulitis without serious adverse effects. However, additional large clinical trials are required to confirm the efficacy and safety of slimming cream for the treatment of cellulitis.
