<h1>Topicals for losing fat: creams with aminophylline and glycyrrhetinic acid</h1>
<p><strong>r/estrogel</strong> • by u/mayoito • 21 points</p>
<div class='post-content'><div class="md"><p>To help with the process of weight cycling, people are now using glitazones to gain fat "in the right places", but it seems to only help during the weight gain phase.</p>
<p>What about the weight loss phase?</p>
<p>Good news is some topicals could help: aminophylline creams with maybe glycyrrhetinic acid.</p>
<p>Aminophilline is backed by recent research (2023) in <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9978326/">https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9978326/</a> and the use of this combination has detailed explanation on a blogpost <a href="https://tim.blog/2011/01/16/spot-reduction-revisited-removing-stubborn-thigh-fat/">https://tim.blog/2011/01/16/spot-reduction-revisited-removing-stubborn-thigh-fat/</a> that seem to have been right even before all the conclusive evidence was gathered.</p>
<p>Based on the pubmed article, there's more evidence for 0.5% aminophylline than for any other concentration (like 2%), however given how aminophylline works, the response curve should be linear so it's more likely there hasn't been enough studies in the final sample (out of the selected 17 studies, only 5 were kept) to make it clear</p>
<p>In theory, the effect of glycyrrhetinic acid would be synergestic with aminophylline, or at least cumulative, however it's been far less studied</p>
<p>I'd suggest whoever is interested in topical fat loss to only consider that a dangerous experiment: it's not clear yet how to formulate these 2 products: a review of the different amazon products featuring aminophylline shows a lot of people complaining that more recent batches of their favorite products have been less efficient that before</p>
<p>Given how products are "reformulated" to cut costs when they become more popular, it's likely the carrier part plays a strong role in how much how the aminophylline is absorbed by the skin.</p>
<p>Still I'd suggest to stick to amazon products while more eyeballs study how to formulate these 2 products into something efficient to be more absorbed, to avoid suggesting something "too efficient" as aminophylline is a PDE (like viagra is, but more broad spectrum) and therefore with potential cardiovascular effects (like increasing the heart rate too much)</p>

<p>this is just a very preliminary post to suggest the use of these substances, that are apparently not very well known on reddit</p>
