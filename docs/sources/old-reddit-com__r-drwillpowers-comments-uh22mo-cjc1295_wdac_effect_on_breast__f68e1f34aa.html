<h1>CJC-1295 w/DAC effect on breast growth and surgery recovery</h1>
<p><strong>r/DrWillPowers</strong> • by u/cyberpunk_trans • 11 points</p>
<div class='post-content'><div class="md"><p>Quick disclaimer: this post <em>does not</em> endorse self medicating with unregulated research chemicals. This is <em>not</em> a DIY post. This post is intended only to spur hypothetical, theoretical discussion regarding the role of GH and IGF-1 as it pertains to breast development and wound healing.</p>
<p>For those unfamiliar; CJC-1295 is a research peptide which temporarily increases the body's natural production of growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1). In theory - because it leverages the body's natural production instead of acting as an exogenous source of growth hormone - it makes supraphisiological levels within the body much less likely (and thus reduce the likelihood of scary side effects like acromegaly).</p>
<p>In online body building circles, this peptide is occasionally referenced as a way to speed up recovery from intense exercise, increase lean muscle mass and reduce body fat.</p>
<p><em>Hypothetically</em>, would this peptide be relevant to speeding up post-surgical healing? For instance, if someone just had a major surgery that involved a lot of rearrangement of soft tissue? Is there existing data to suggest that increased GH and IGF-1 levels speed up surgical healing, which could be logically extended to hypothesize a similar effect from the application of this research peptide? Is there perhaps even anecdotal evidence of CJC-1295 being used in this context?</p>
<p>Likewise, it has been well-observed in this subreddit that there appears to be a potential correlation between IGF-1 levels and breast size. <em>Theoretically</em>, if other environmental factors are already optimal, could the application of this peptide potentially boost breast growth?</p>
<p>Again, <em>I'm not suggesting that anyone go out and experiment with this</em>, but knowing that there <em>are</em> people in the world who <em>do</em> take such risks, have we been able to gain any useful information from their experiences?</p>
<p>Edited to <em>further</em> clarify and distance this post from any endorsement or discussion of DIY.</p>

                <div class="md"><p>Very interesting!!  Do you mind if I ask a couple of questions?  Under what circumstances did your doctor prescribed CJC 1295?  Are you taking orally or by injection?  If by injection to what part of the breast are you injecting if you are injecting of course.  When you say it had a 'positive effect' how positive was it and did your breasts if in fact this is what you were taking it for get itchy like when we have growth spurts?  Sorry for all of the questions but I'm quite interested personally.  Thanks!</p>

<p>"Despite the apparent necessity of GH/IGF-1 signaling in pubertal breast development however, women with Laron syndrome, in whom the growth hormone receptor (GHR) is defective and insensitive to GH and serum IGF-1 levels are very low, puberty, including breast development, is delayed, although full sexual maturity is always eventually reached.[15] Moreover, breast development and size are normal (albeit delayed) in spite of GH/IGF-1 axis insufficiency, and in some the breasts may actually be large in relation to body size.[15][16] The relatively large breasts in women with Laron syndrome have been suggested to be due to increased secretion of prolactin (which is known to produce breast enlargement) caused by a drift phenomenon from somatomammotrophic cells in the pituitary gland with a high GH secretion.[15][16] An animal model of Laron syndrome, the GHR knockout mouse, shows severely impaired ductal outgrowth at 11 weeks of age.[17][18][19] However, by 15 weeks, ductal development has caught up with that of normal mice and the ducts have fully distributed throughout the mammary fat pad, although the ducts remain narrower than those of wild-type mice.[17][18][19] In any case, female GHR knockout mice can lactate normally.[17][19] As such, it has been said that the phenotypes of women with Laron syndrome and GHR knockout mice are identical, with diminished body size and delayed sexual maturation accompanied by normal lactation.[17] <strong>These data indicate that very low circulating levels of IGF-1 can nonetheless allow for full pubertal breast development</strong>.[15][17]"</p>
