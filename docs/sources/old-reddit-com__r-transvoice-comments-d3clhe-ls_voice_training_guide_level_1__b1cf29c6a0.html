<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Hey, friend. Want to change your voice? Well... you <em>can</em> - that's an option.</p>
<p>Your voice is much more malleable than you may realize. There are at least a dozen different dimensions that you can learn to control independently to change the sound of your voice. The way you talk right now is not your one "true" voice, it is a <em>habit</em>. A habit that can be changed, if you so choose.</p>
<p>I like to come at this challenge from two angles. One is to break down all the muscle movements involved and learn to manipulate them individually, through simple <em>drills</em>. The other is to listen to carefully selected example voices and learn to <em>imitate</em> them, intuitively. You will get results much faster by using both, as you do in this guide.</p>
<p>My approach to voice training is not a process of feminization. It is a journey in flexibility, to full <em>fluency</em> over the entire possibility space of your voice. This guide is aimed at those of you who are already comfortable in the masculine end of the spectrum. With the exercises I've gathered here, you will familiarize yourself with the feminine end - and everything in between.</p>
<p>Once you have gained complete freedom across your vocal range, you can <em>choose</em> exactly where you'd like to live - whether that is within one voice, or two. Or three. Masculine, feminine, or androgynous, young or old, human or cartoon. Any or all. It's up to you.</p>
<p>So now, <strong>listen to <a href="https://clyp.it/5eq3io3u">this clip</a></strong> to hear me demonstrate the eight most important elements for vocal feminization, gradually transforming a masculine voice into a feminine one. Then, <strong>listen to <a href="https://clyp.it/ggetrab2">this clip</a></strong> to hear how they sound one at a time, in isolation. With practice, you can learn to do this too!</p>
<p>Most of the material in this guide can be traced back to the pioneering work of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/ZheannaErose">Zheanna Erose</a> of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBYlEnfAUbrYSwF0VujcmHA">TransVoiceLessons</a>, as well as the excellent free tutorial videos at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/NewYorkVocalCoaching">New York Vocal Coaching</a>. Many thanks, also, to the <a href="https://cramdvoicelessons.blog/about/">Scinguistics</a> community, and of course, all of you lovely people here on <a href="/r/transvoice">r/transvoice</a>!</p>
<p>I've organized this guide into four levels, from Foundations to Mastery, each split into three subsections. You could easily spend a month on each level - a week or two per subsection. But you don't have to master each subsection before moving on to the next. Just give yourself enough time to digest the material and get a feel for it, and then start the next subsection as soon as you no longer feel overwhelmed.</p>
<p>Ready? Let's begin.</p>
<p>~L</p>
<h1>Level 1 - Foundations</h1>
<h2>1. Inspiration</h2>
<p>Start by watching <a href="https://youtu.be/dZKzuVfUv3E">this video</a> for a really quick overview of the voice feminization process (and optionally, <a href="https://youtu.be/ynFqjE2AEGk">this video</a> to learn more about the acoustic theory involved). Then watch <a href="https://youtu.be/xVAVi11kzbM?t=133">this video</a> for a breakdown of the vocal anatomy involved.</p>
<p><strong>Your homework is</strong> to find a recording of a female speaking voice that you'd like to be able to imitate, that can serve as an <em>inspiration</em> and a point of reference. It doesn't have to be the one perfect, ultimate voice - just find one or two examples that seem pleasant and relatable. Think of female actresses or characters with nice voices, or YouTubers or podcast hosts you enjoy (search for "female youtubers" or "female podcast hosts" if you need some ideas). Mine is <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1pIUvhv59np_tDRK7w0s75IQ3ByIoG6bs">this podcast interview with Keon Saghari</a>. Go ahead and use that if you can't decide on one right now!</p>
<p>Then start listening to it, at least a little bit every day. This will help you internalize the sounds and speech patterns of the voice that you like. And be on the lookout for new voices - if you find one you like better, start listening to that one instead!</p>
<h2>2. Vocal Tract Length</h2>
<p>Next you want to start strengthening and learning to control the muscles that raise your <em>larynx</em> (or voice box). This is how you shorten the <em>length of your vocal tract</em>, from your larynx to your lips, to match the proportions of a typical female vocal tract. Building these muscles will take a while, so we'll start with this first.</p>
<p>Do not do the <em>swallow-and-hold</em> exercise from <a href="https://youtu.be/aWWevU4A5mU">this video</a>, as the <em>hold</em> can cause unnecessary strain, but do try <em>swallowing</em> a few times. You want to touch your larynx (Adam's apple) lightly with your finger, and then yawn and feel it move down, and then swallow and feel it move up.</p>
<p>Once you have felt this a few times, watch <a href="https://youtu.be/mx4dPWKVt9o">this video</a> and try the <em>"big dog, small dog"</em> exercise. If you're having trouble with the small dog, it can help to start yawning, to bring the larynx down, and then start to swallow to bring the larynx up, and then stick your tongue out like a dog panting and say "ahh" in a whisper to make sure you're not closing off your throat. Then watch <a href="https://youtu.be/F6Noi2qERus">this video</a> and try the <em>whisper siren</em> exercise.  You want to smoothly slide from a big dog "uhh" to a small dog "ehh" as your larynx slides upward. Again, place a finger or two lightly on your throat to feel your larynx move up and down.</p>
<p><strong>Your homework is</strong> to practice the whisper siren for few minutes whenever you remember, throughout the day - say, whenever you go to the bathroom. It's almost silent, so you can do it anywhere and practice holding your muscles in place at the top (the high end of the siren, or the small dog) to build strength. Eventually, you want to learn to lift your larynx easily, without straining the muscles in your jaw and neck. As you get more comfortable with it, try to relax your neck a little bit more each time, until you can do it without tension.</p>
<h2>3. Pitch</h2>
<p>Keep doing the previous exercises every day, but when you're ready for something more, you can start working on your <em>pitch</em>, or how high or low your voice is. Pitch is just one of many elements, and not even the most important, but it's probably the most well-known difference between the average male and female voice.</p>
<p>In addition to pitch, there are several <em>registers</em> that your voice will lock into at different points along your range, each with a different sound quality. Watch <a href="https://youtu.be/CYEsGuldIQY">this video</a> to hear the differences between a <em>chest voice</em> and a falsetto (and a <em>mix voice</em>, which is technically the same register as your chest voice, your <em>modal register</em>). Follow along with the warmups in <a href="https://youtu.be/9-1Padxsmio?t=281">this video</a>, and then try switching between the registers a few times, both singing and speaking.</p>
<p>Then download the Android app <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tadaoyamaoka.vocalpitchmonitor&amp;hl=en_US">Vocal Pitch Monitor</a> (or <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/vocal-pitch-monitor/id842218231">Vocal Pitch Monitor</a> on iOS) and in the settings, change the <em>Scale</em> to <em>D Major</em> and check the box to <em>Display frequency in Hz</em>. With the app running, talk in your starting voice and see where your pitch falls, naturally. A typical male speaking voice will stay between D2 and D3 (which are marked by horizontal lines, since we set the Scale to D Major). Now try talking higher and higher in pitch, until your voice is in the female range, around D3 (150 Hz) and above. Don't go higher than D4 (300 Hz), though, or you'll sound like a cartoon character!</p>
<p>You might find that you start in your modal register when you're in the male range, but flip over into falsetto at some point in order to get into the female range. Or you might find that you have to strain and shout to get that high. If that happens, just go back down to the pitch where you can still speak comfortably in your modal register and don't worry about going higher for now.</p>
<p><strong>Your homework is</strong> to set aside some time every day (say, half an hour) to warm up with the video above and then practice speaking in the female range (between D3 and D4, or 150-300 Hz) or as close as you can get without straining or going into a falsetto. You can just say random things that pop into your head, recite lines from memory, or read a book or reddit comments out loud, while keeping an eye on your pitch in Vocal Pitch Monitor.</p>
<p>It might sound terrible, but that's okay - the important thing is to get used to speaking in that range. Drink water throughout and take a break if you feel your voice getting strained or hoarse.</p>

                <div class="md"><p>Something you might add, perhaps as an appendix, is what an example practice session might look like at each level. I can't speak for others, but I have issues constructing my own study plans, so having even an example of what a day at each level looks like would be super helpful.</p>
<p>Btw, your guide is fantastic and even without a steady study plan I've made great progress with it. Thank you for putting this guide together!</p>

<p>As far as how long to spend on each part...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've organized this guide into four levels, from Foundations to Mastery, each split into three subsections. You could easily spend a month on each level - a week or two per subsection. But you don't have to master each subsection before moving on to the next. Just give yourself enough time to digest the material and get a feel for it, and then start the next subsection as soon as you no longer feel overwhelmed.</p>

<p>Fortunately for me, my voice never fully dropped as a teenager and talking to people face to face I've had no issue passing for years now.</p>
<p>Unfortunately though, thanks to a combination of autistic traits and being very quiet when young I tend to speak very monotone and have virtually no range. This means I get called sir on the phone about 50% of the time, and if I try to raise the pitch my voice just cuts out and there's nothing there. Even the slightest raise in pitch makes my voice a bit croaky and I sound like i have emphysema.. which isn't great for a 28 year old who's never smoked.</p>

<p>Are you looking for some guidance on how to gain more fluency with your voice and pitch? I would say that singing exercises in general are going to be the most helpful, though you'll need to do really simple, easy stuff to start with. There's a wealth of free singing tutorials, from beginner to advanced, at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/NewYorkVocalCoaching/playlists">New York Vocal Coaching on YouTube</a> - definitely check that out.</p>
<p>As far as learning to change your pitch without getting croaky, it sounds like you may need to start really simple and practice what are known as "semi-occluded vocal tract exercises" (SOVTE). They are a little boring, but they may be a necessary first step (they're good for anyone to practice, honestly). You can search for examples on YouTube, but here is <a href="https://clyp.it/5sv2mqhi/">an introduction</a> and some <a href="https://clyp.it/dm45eshb">example exercises</a> from <a href="/u/demivierge">u/demivierge</a>.</p>
<p>Also, are you able to do a relaxed sigh or yawn with your voice, where you slide down in pitch as you go, without sounding croaky? :o</p>
<p>Let me know if that helps! :)</p>

<p>I just have one question. I'm currently on pitch and whenever I begin speaking, my voice starts at around F3 but quickly drops to around B2. Is consistency something that will just come with practice, or do I need to specifically try to keep my voice steady?</p>

Just practice keeping your voice steady without dropping below a certain line (and eventually get that line higher until it's around F3) and your consistency will improve. ;)</p>

                <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>In addition to pitch, there are several <em>registers</em> that your voice will lock into at different points along your range, each with a different sound quality. Watch <a href="https://youtu.be/CYEsGuldIQY">this video</a> to hear the differences between a <em>chest voice</em> and a falsetto (and a <em>mix voice</em>, which is technically the same register as your chest voice, your <em>modal register</em>). Follow along with the warmups in <a href="https://youtu.be/9-1Padxsmio?t=281">this video</a>, and then try switching between the registers a few times, both singing and speaking.  </p>
<p>Then download the Android app <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tadaoyamaoka.vocalpitchmonitor&amp;hl=en_US">Vocal Pitch Monitor</a> (or <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/vocal-pitch-monitor/id842218231">Vocal Pitch Monitor</a> on iOS) and in the settings, change the <em>Scale</em> to <em>F Major</em> and check the box to <em>Display frequency in Hz</em>. With the app running, talk in your starting voice and see where your pitch falls, naturally. A typical male speaking voice will stay between F2 and F3 (which are marked by horizontal lines, since we set the Scale to F Major). Now try talking higher and higher in pitch, until your voice is in the female range, around F3 and above. Don't go higher than F4, though, or you'll sound like a cartoon character!</p>

<p>I don't really get this. How do I change register? Do the piano notes matter? How do I <em>try talking higher and higher in pitch</em>?</p>

<p>Lots of hanging out in voice chats with people who can identify what they're hearing and open lessons and whatever, using a real-time spectrograph so I can see what I might not hear (especially while focused on making sounds, or dissociating because I'm overwhelmed), and just playing around with sounds a ton have helped.</p>
<p>like, I'll just start talking and try to slowly change something about my vocal posture to an extreme without an intentional sound to see what happens and how far I can go.  the result is usually something super cartoonish, but that's fine; it's just building a sense of what happens how that piece effects my voice. It doesn't even need to be words, sometimes I'll just hold a vowel and move my mouth/throat around while listening and watching. For a while, my party trick was to make didgeridoo noises, or to talk like a rejected Rugrats character.</p>
<p>I'm still not where I wanted to be, but I've gotten to a more or less comfortable place. I'm not spending whole days on it anymore, and it's been a while since I've done intentional voice training... so I guess part of my progress has been in learning to love where I've gotten even it it wasn't where I meant to go.</p>

Also hate to ask again but I've also tried lowering my larynx after it reaches its peak but I'm having a lot of difficulty with it, any advice on this? Also thank you for helping me with my previous question.
Edit: Or should I only start practicing to lower and raise it once I've got enough strength to keep it up myself? Edit 2: Nevermind, figured it out</p>

<p>I have a question though, as a natural progression of  BDSD shouldn't you train with vowels with high larynx like in the video and Dakota's doc before moving on ? Or is it actually not necessary ?</p>

<p>Training different vowels with the "big dog, small dog" exercise is a good way to start learning to hold the high larynx posture while speaking, but it's not something that is relevant until section 4, on Resonance. For section 2, the idea is just to start getting used to moving the larynx at all, and building up the coordination and strength to move it smoothly and easily, without tension. But feel free to play with vowels and speech if you feel inspired to do a little extra credit! ;D</p>

<p>I do have another (hopefully relevant) question though, in section 3 when lifting the pitch, is it important to keep the larynx at baseline height, because I find myself slightly lifting it as well as my pitch, which is part of section 4 I understand, is this gonna mess up the whole thing, should I really try and keep my larynx 'neutral' while doing this exercise ?</p>

            <div>
                <div class="md"><p>Good question! :) Honestly, it's not a big deal if your larynx raises a bit when you raise your pitch - that's a natural reflex, and it takes a lot of work to learn to isolate the two completely, which isn't even that important for voice feminization. I wouldn't worry about that part. ;)</p>
<p>The main thing to watch out for is your pitch jumping too high when you raise your larynx super high, not the other way around. If you can learn to keep your pitch constant as your larynx raises, that's great, and it's honestly a pretty advanced thing to practice. :)</p>

(started 'bout a week ago) or is it just my anatomy (I have a goiter and lost 3 molars+no 3rd molars) and larynx+pitch+OQ just isn't enough ?</p>

Getting that to a more unambiguously feminine sound is where the oral resonance and articulation start to really make a difference.</p>

I had some experience doing voices to play board games, but I didn't know about the voice mix thing. It really helps you out once you know your lowest (chest voice) pitch and your highest (falsetto) pitch, then I tried to find a spot in between where I was comfortable talking. Out of nowhere I found a mix perfectly in the female voice range and I've talking to myself for the last 2h. I can't believe I was actually able to do it that quick! Now I'm gonna work on the next steps. Thank yoooou &lt;3</p>

<p>I actually got a good grasp of everything except pitch. Pitch is the only part that I can't train immediately because I think I need to actually exercise the muscle... I can't get any higher than F3 without straining and holding it there is also a big challenge. I guess that's something that just comes with time and practice.</p>

                <div class="md"><p>If you're tone-deaf, you may rely more heavily on pitch apps (Vocal Pitch Monitor) for your pitch practice and it may take longer to develop the habit of staying within your desired pitch range. It's possible that getting a feel for intonation patterns may be more challenging as well, but not necessarily.</p>
<p>You should have at least one female voice reference in the language you speak (English, I assume) but you can also have one in Japanese in addition. Just make sure you listen to both.</p>
<p>If you're practicing daily, you may find that you can sporadically hit a passing voice in a few months but not fully have consistent access to it until you have a few more months of training, including in social situations. I'd say at least six months to a year to become really solid and consistent in your voice. Based on my experience so far - it's hard! :d</p>

                <div class="md"><p>This is great! I socially transitioned 6 months ago and have been voice training for a long time. My main issue is consistency. On the phone I always get gendered correctly when speaking to strangers but my main issues are psychological. When speaking to someone I know, or speaking to people face to face, I often automatically masculinize my voice and find tit very hard not to. I've been told it's a common issue due to multi-tasking but I think it's a self-consciousness thing.
Also, at work we have to wear earplugs and I find that trying to talk loud enough for people to hear me plus the changed sound the earplugs make cause me to drop into male voice often if only to be heard for safety reasons (lots of machinery).
Any tips on either of these issues would be absolutely amazing, in the mean time I will start to go through this guide as time permits! 
Thank you again x</p>

<p>I'm currently doing vocal tract length, haven't started on pitch, but:</p>
<p>When I stop exhaling (do I have to stop exhaling?) on the whispering siren, my Larynx (I'm not deep into puberty, so not sure if it's a really small adam's apple or just a non grown one) goes down slowly, like it drifts down) and I dont like that, at all, but I'm not sure why it hat happens.</p>
<p>So a possible fix I guessed would be to hold it like with swallow and hold, but that only comes with more questions, because:Swallow and hold requires a specific vocal and tongue position, not just tension, so if I use that, I'm faraid i won't be able to progress further, since in that vocal position I canpt reathe nor talk.</p>
<p>I probably missed a couple of things here. If I remember, I'll edit this. Thank you!!</p>

                <div class="md"><p>So, raising the larynx will often raise both pitch and resonance simultaneously as a side effect, but the resonance is the important part in this case. There are also other ways to raise pitch - the larynx height is only one piece of the puzzle.</p>

                <div class="md"><p>It's still helpful to work on pitch for other benefits, like making it easier to increase your open quotient later. And having a bit more pitch range will be helpful even if you're already easily in the female range. </p>
<p>But if you want to spend less time on pitch and more time on things like resonance right now, that would also make sense! :)</p>

I do have a question though; how do I know if the larynx exercises are working/having an affect? Like swallow/hold I can feel my larynx move, but I can't say the same for big dog/small dog or whisper siren, and I'm afraid I'm doing something wrong. Thank you!</p>
<p>Edited to say that I can somewhat get whisper siren to work (like with my finger feel the larynx slide up) but I can't make any actual sound come out</p>

                <div class="md"><p>It may take a lot of practice and experimentation to get to the point where you can use the whisper siren or big dog small dog to move your larynx, but moving it is the goal and metric for success at this stage! </p>
<p>Don't worry about making a sound just yet - that can come later. Work on controlling the movement and using as little effort and tension as possible. Relaxed movement is the goal. :)</p>

            <div>
                <div class="md"><p>It's hard to predict how long it will take to develop a skill. But practicing it more frequently throughout the day is more important than practicing it longer per session. So if you break that 10 minutes up into 2-minute sessions throughout the day, that will be more effective than a single 10-minute session.</p>
<p>I would expect to spend a week or two getting familiar with that skill before layering on the next section's skill. Keep practicing it even after you've started working on new skills though! :)</p>

I have two characters’ voices that I really enjoy and would like to use, but they don’t speak much for English, so I’m wondering if me not being fluent in their native language would cause an issue.

So when I do the whisper siren my small dog doesn’t sound as high as the video and when I get to the small dog I can’t create a solid sound like she can, it’s like a hoarse noise. Are these things just because my larynx isn’t used to this position or am I doing something wrong?</p>
