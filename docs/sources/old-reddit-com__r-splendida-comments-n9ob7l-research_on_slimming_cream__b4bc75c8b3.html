<p>Below are several peer reviewed studies that show it’s efficacy (edit - and that’s the only reason I’m sharing this don’t downvote me the science shows it helps. Two groups had a exercise regimen and the group that used the cream lost more circumference than the placebo group.) 
FYI this ingredient is contraindicated for asthma. </p>

<p>I was skeptical but if you try it (along with exercise) worst case it was a waste of $...</p>

                <div class="md"><p>There are no quick fixes to “slimming” that require little to no effort and have significant results.  In the study, both the aminophylline and the placebo group had a walking regimen (leg workout) and CALORIC DEFICIT that lead to results.  Both groups had very similar results.
If you want to be slimmer, a caloric deficit is the way.  Working out is for toning- you can’t exercise away a bad diet.  Want to level up?  Put in the effort or get surgery.  There are no shortcuts.  Worst case scenario is also not wasted $ when it comes to WL drugs.</p>

                <div class="md"><p>Did I misread/misinterpret the results?</p>
<p>Particularly on the study related to waist circumference,  the BMI reduction was the same between groups but the aminophylline group had an 11 +/- 1cm waist reduction compared to 5.0 +/- 0.6cm in the control. That is definitely a significant difference!</p>
<p>What I take away from the study is that while exercise and calorie deficit is still required to lose the weight, this cream helps proportionately more fat be lost from the stomach.</p>

<p>Yes, science works. Celebs wont be using that bc they aren't risk takers. They want safety and known good results backed by years of experience.</p>

                <div class="md"><p>Exactly. I'm not sure how many studies there are on aminophylline/targeted weight loss, but a super quick look through the literature only shows a handful since the 21st century. </p>
<p>I highly doubt any beauty expert would be recommending a treatment with only a few studies backing it just from fear of repercussions if it doesnt work/goes wrong! </p>
<p>Also even celebrities cant have a treatment before its invented. Aminophylline for targeted fat removal is relatively new and the research on it seems to be slow.</p>

" <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28956468/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28956468/</a> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cellulite is a common topographical alteration where skin acquires an orange peel or mattress appearance with alterations in adipose tissue and microcirculation. This work aims to develop and evaluate a topical niosomal gel formulae with good permeation to reach the subcutaneous fat layer. Several caffeine niosomal dispersions were prepared and incorporated into gel formulae using Carbopol 940 polymer, chemical penetration enhancers, and iontophoresis, then the prepared gels were applied onto the skin of rats and anticellulite activity of caffeine from the prepared gels compared to that of the commercial product Cellu Destock® was evaluated by histological study of the skin and measurement of plasma level of caffeine passing through the skin using liquid chromatography (LC/MS-MS). Results of histology revealed reduction of size and thickness of fatty layer of rat skin in the following order: FVII &gt; FXIV &gt; Cellu Destock® &gt; FVII + Iontophoresis &gt; FXIV + Iontophoresis. Pharmacokinetic results of caffeine in plasma revealed that Cmax, Tmax, and AUC0-12h decreased in the following order: FXIV &gt; FVII &gt; Cellu Destock®. These results conclude that incorporation of caffeine niosomal dispersion into gel matrix with penetration enhancers and iontophoresis resulted in improvement in penetration of caffeine through the skin into the underlying fatty layer in treatment of cellulite.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Natural products such as caffeine have been found to be effective in reducing body weight through lipolysis. Here, we report the successful loading of caffeine onto dissolving microneedle following inhibition of its crystal growth by hyaluronic acid (HA), the matrix material of the dissolving microneedle (DMN). Further, the anti-obesity activity of caffeine was evaluated in high-fat diet-induced obese C57BL/6J mice. After 6weeks of caffeine loaded dissolving microneedle patch (CMP) administration, lipolysis improved significantly as shown by leptin and adiponectin activity, which resulted in considerable weight loss of about 12.8±0.75% in high-fat diet-induced obese mice. Comparison of the levels of triglyceride, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol after CMP administration with the initial levels in obese mice indicated significant anti-obesity activity of CMP. These findings suggested that a novel CMP with an increased amount of caffeine loaded onto DMN has therapeutic activity against obesity. </p>

<p>"Improvement of a slimming cream's efficacy using a novel fabric as a transdermal drug delivery system: An in vivo and in vitro study " - <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32266024/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32266024/</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Penetration of any compound into the body from the outside is prevented primarily by the corneal layer of the epidermis. The only way to circumvent the properties of the corneal layer is to disrupt it. Currently, transdermal systems can currently only deliver drugs that are of low molecular weight. The purpose of the present study was to assess the improvement of the slimming cream's efficacy using a novel fabric, with the aim of developing an improved method for transdermal drug delivery. The current study was conducted on four groups of guinea pigs. The control group was untreated, whereas the test groups were treated with either slimming cream and no fabric, slimming cream with 100% cotton fabric or slimming cream with the novel fabric. Ultrasound and microscopic histological analysis were used to assess animals. The results demonstrated that compared with the other groups, the novel fabric group demonstrated the greatest reductions in fat layer thickness, adipocyte size and number and proliferator-activated receptor-γ levels in adipose tissue. Furthermore, the novel fabric also enhanced the transdermal delivery of rhodamine B base and caffeine penetration compared with the control fabric (3.18-fold). In conclusion, the results of the present study demonstrated that the novel fabric can potentially be used to enhance transdermal drug delivery. </p>

<p>If you want to do that, I'd suggest skipping aminophylline, yohimbine, carnitine (etc) and just making niosomes with a caffeine powder off amazon - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niosome">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niosome</a> as there's a lot of evidence in favor of topical caffeine causing fat loss (and little contra indications for coffee lol)</p>
<p>If you want to learn how to homebrew, check <a href="/r/diybeauty">r/diybeauty</a> <a href="/r/estrogel">r/estrogel</a> and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24220497/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24220497/</a> <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27145899/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27145899/</a> ; you don't need a lot of equipment if you stick to liposomes/ethosomes/niosomes - except maybe an ultrasound jewelry cleaner.</p>
<p>Google for the Mozafari method and its adaptations, it can be a bit ghetto but it works at home with limited supplies and equipment!</p>
