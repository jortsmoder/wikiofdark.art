<h1>Lumina Probiotic worked for me!</h1>
<html><body><div><div><p id="block0">In September, I applied<span><span><a href="https://luminaprobiotic.com/"> Lumina probiotic</a></span></span><span class="footnote-reference" data-footnote-id="l1ixoi8fzwa" data-footnote-index="1" data-footnote-reference="" id="fnrefl1ixoi8fzwa" role="doc-noteref"><sup><span><a class="" href="#fnl1ixoi8fzwa">[1]</a></span></sup></span>to my mouth. I did this around noon. I noticed effects within six hours. Usually my mouth would begin developing a... <i>taste </i>even just a few hours after I brushed my teeth. But at 6 pm that day, there was no off taste! And at midnight -- after dinner but before brushing my teeth -- still no off taste or bad breath. I kissed my girlfriend at the time, who remarked that my mouth tasted different. I brushed my teeth and went to bed around 1 am. </p><p id="block1">A strange thing happened. As I lay in bed, I began feeling some kind of sensation in my mouth. It's difficult to describe. It wasn't constant; it would come in waves or pulses. Sometimes it felt like nothing in particular -- maybe I was just being hyperaware of my mouth, like if somebody had told me to pay attention to what my tongue feels like. Sometimes it felt like... definitely something. It's not a sensation I had ever felt before, or have felt since the first few days of Lumina. The closest comparison I can make is to the feeling pineapple gives your tongue. It was slightly unpleasant and distracting. I actually woke up multiple times that night and I'm pretty sure it was due to that feeling in my mouth/tongue, because the feeling was the first thing I noticed when waking. I got a bit of this feeling the next day and night as well. And then it went away.</p><p id="block2"><strong>My Oral Background: </strong>I've had somewhat bad teeth my whole life. I had lots of cavities as a kid (but I didn't brush, lol). As an adult (I'm in my late 20s) I've had a few cavities. Before Lumina, my mouth would get an off taste very quickly after cleaning -- like, I'd start noticing in an hour (regardless of whether I ate). My teeth also would get "grimy" (non smooth feeling) in a few hours. In general I felt like I got bad breath significantly faster than other people. I had bad breath in the morning. I also had problems with my tongue; I had to tongue scrape twice (sometimes more!) a day, and a <i>lot </i>of stuff would come off. I didn't have any infections, this was just my life. I didn't have these mouth taste and tongue problems when I was a kid or teenager; they seemed to develop when I was about 20 and got worse over time.</p><p id="block3"><strong>Post Lumina: </strong>I wake up without bad breath. I only get an off taste in my mouth if my mouth has been dry or I ate something funky. This off taste is <strong>not </strong>accompanied by bad breath. I still have to tongue scrape regularly, and if I don't then I do get bad breath. In general my mouth just feels a whole lot cleaner. I haven't noticed any mild tooth pain from acidity or hot/cold (which I would occasionally get pre-Lumina). </p><ol class="footnote-section footnotes" data-footnote-section="" role="doc-endnotes"><li class="footnote-item" data-footnote-id="l1ixoi8fzwa" data-footnote-index="1" data-footnote-item="" id="fnl1ixoi8fzwa" role="doc-endnote"><span class="footnote-back-link" data-footnote-back-link="" data-footnote-id="l1ixoi8fzwa"><sup><strong><a href="#fnrefl1ixoi8fzwa">^</a></strong></sup></span></li></ol></div></div></body></html>
