<p>Let me preface this by saying, YES – when you email me or send me a message, it is really me (Lucy) who is answering you! I have no customer service employees. I am a one woman show wearing 17 different hats, and there are limited hours in a day.</p>
<p>This blog and my Youtube channel is my passion, and I don’t want to shut it all down from exhaustion – but I also don’t want to ignore those individuals who truly need the help.</p>
<p>I have over 700 helpful videos, and there is a 95% chance that you will at said find the answer to your question in one of them – please consider typing your question into the search bar of this site or on Youtube, and watch the video before <a href="#contact">contacting me</a>.</p>
<p>If you have a question that is better suited to the customer service desk of a specific corset brand (e.g. pricing, sizes, return policies, shipping times), please contact that brand’s customer service, as I am not a paid employee of any other brand and I do not earn a commission on any sales except those that are purchased <a href="/shop">directly from my shop here.</a></p>

<summary><strong><span>I’m a total beginner to corseting, where do I start?</span></strong></summary>
<p>Here is my playlist on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC6B380E5D1D41A14" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Corseting: General Information (START HERE)">General Information about corseting</a>. I discuss everything from corseting goals to regimens, from how to buy a corset to how to care for it. Any lifestyle questions that remain unanswered here (like how to sleep or go to the toilet while wearing a corset), you will find in my <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0F578952365CE673" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Physical Effects of Corseting">“Physical Effects” playlist</a>.</p>

<summary><strong><span>What happens to the body when you corset? Is it dangerous?</span></strong></summary>
<p>On the condition that you’re already in good health before corseting, you wear a well-fitting corset responsibly and lace down slowly, and you have realistic goals, corseting is not dangerous. The corset has been blamed for many diseases and ailments for which it was not responsible at all – however, in some cases (like high blood pressure or uterine prolapse) corseting can exacerbate pre-existing conditions so I <em>always</em> recommend speaking with your doctor about any concerns before trying a corset. That said, I have also heard hundreds of stories of how corsets have <a href="https://lucycorsetry.com/2012/06/16/how-corsets-heal/" title="How Corsets Heal: 20 Benefits">helped people with pre-existing medical issues!</a> I outline both the risks and benefits to wearing corsets in my playlist “<a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0F578952365CE673" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Physical Effects of Corseting">Physical Effects of Corseting</a>.” Most of the videos are organized based on the system of concern, although there is understandably some overlap as the body works as one. This list also includes tips on going to the bathroom and sleeping in your corset. If you have very specific questions of a medical nature, I am <em>not</em> a doctor and I am not qualified to diagnose you – I recommend you direct your questions to your trusted physician.</p>

<summary><strong><span>I don’t know how to lace my corset!/ I would like to try a different form of lacing. Can you help me?</span></strong></summary>
<p>There are dozens upon dozens of helpful video tutorials on lacing up your corset on Youtube, but if you would like to see how I officially lace my own corsets, do check out my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLd2O_kYv6eJzznUWJIvmKBPxKARhRqN5C" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Lacing Techniques playlist here</a>. More often than not, I prefer the “inverted bunny ears” method of lacing.</p>

<summary><span><strong>What do you think of (insert corset brand)? Is it any good? Which corsets have you reviewed already?</strong></span></summary>
<p>I’ve reviewed over 70 different corsets from over 40 different brands, and have tried on/ tested over 100 corsets, so there is a good chance that I’ve tried the corset brand you’re interested in! I have three different playlists for corset reviews: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL93B1316AC63E0BA4" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">underbust OTR corsets</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?action_edit=1&amp;list=PLd2O_kYv6eJxjSpdRm1kKjRqijU7MOjTg" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">overbust OTR corsets</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLd2O_kYv6eJza3a8OubV0UrifN8A-tCLU" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">custom/ bespoke corsets</a>. I make objective reviews, stating the facts wherever possible (unless I’m commenting on the fit/ comfort) – to get the most from these reviews, you need a fair understanding of the parts of a corset and where you would be willing to sacrifice quality for your budget or time constraints. If you have no prior knowledge, please <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC6B380E5D1D41A14" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Corseting: General Information (START HERE)">see my playlist for beginners</a>.</p>

<summary><span><strong>What is the BEST corset on the market, or the BEST one I can find for (insert budget)?</strong></span></summary>
<p>There is no one best corset that will fit every person. That would be like saying there’s one shoe to fit (and flatter) every foot. You are welcome to look at <a href="https://lucycorsetry.com/research-corset-brands/can-i-waist-train-in-that-corset/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Can I Waist Train in That Corset?">this page which tells you whether the OTR corsets I’ve tried will hold up to waist training</a>/daily wear (in my opinion). Also have a look through my corset reviews (see the question above this) and decide for yourself which corset you like best for the price, silhouette, quality and construction. I have <a href="https://lucycorsetry.com/corset-brands-by-price-range/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Corset Brands by Price Range">organized the brands I’ve tried by budget</a> as well, if that is your your highest priority. If your highest priority is buying local, consulting in person with a professional and having someone take your measurements, you might be able to find a <a href="https://lucycorsetry.com/corsetiere-map/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Corsetiere Map">corsetiere who lives near you</a>. If you know your specific measurements and want to buy a corset based on its curviness/ silhouette, see my <a href="https://lucycorsetry.com/research-corset-brands/corset-dimensions-directory/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Corset Dimensions Directory (Lace-Base)">Corset Dimensions Directory (Lace Base) here</a>.  Or if you would like to bypass the reviews and have me hand-pick several corsets based on your needs and preferences, please <a href="https://lucycorsetry.com/corset-consultation/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Consultation">see my consultation service</a>.</p>

<summary><span><strong>I have a special case and I’m looking for a very specific type of corset. Where can I find a corset for scoliosis/ a mesh summer corset/ a plus size corset/ a men’s corset?</strong></span></summary>
<p>I have many different pages dedicated to specific types of corsetry in my <a href="https://lucycorsetry.com/research-corset-brands/guided-galleries/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Guided Galleries">Guided Galleries</a> – whether you’re looking for a specific silhouette, or a corset for a medical condition, or with a rare aesthetic (such as fan-lacing, lattice corsets or corset-bodies), chances are you will be able to find what you’re looking for in the <a href="https://lucycorsetry.com/research-corset-brands/guided-galleries/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Guided Galleries">Guided Galleries</a>.</p>

<summary><span><strong>I want to make my own corset. Can you help me?</strong></span></summary>
<p>If you’re stuck on a step and just need clarification on how to proceed, I can help. Unfortunately I do not offer corset making classes at this time. If you don’t know the first thing about making corsets, I invite you to check out my <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8EACEB0EE25ED3A6" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Corset Making Playlist">Corset Making playlist</a> on Youtube. There are also plenty of corset making resources out there, including groups both on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/#!/groups/353021271395703/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Learn How to Make Corsets Like a Pro! Facebook group">Facebook</a> and on <a href="http://corsetmakers.livejournal.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Corset Makers LiveJournal group">LiveJournal</a>, and also instructional books and DVDs (some of which I’ve featured in my <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLd2O_kYv6eJyc1Mc8gYJO2kQmPKCSmmrY" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Corset Book Reviews">book reviews playlist here</a>).</p>

<summary><span><strong>Is there anything I should wear with my corset?</strong></span></summary>
<p>You can wear almost anything you like with your corset! But whether you prefer to wear your corset under or over clothing, you will find some inspiration in this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLd2O_kYv6eJxOv9kcE53P5jA8z4PNRY77" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Dressing with your Corset playlist">“Dressing with your Corset” playlist</a>.</p>

<summary><span><strong>My corset broke!/ My corset doesn’t fit!/ Can I alter my cheap corset to be better?</strong></span></summary>
<p>If you’re looking to completely rework your cheap, too-big or worn-out corset, it’s usually easier to start a new corset from scratch than to save the old one. Sometimes it’s better worth your time and money to sell your old corset and use the money you made to put towards a new corset. But if you’re looking to do some slight alterations or repairs, then you’ll find some helpful videos here in my <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4BC34C0878F1FED6" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Corset Modifications &amp; Repairs">Corset Modifications &amp; Repairs playlist </a>(known unofficially as “Pimp my Corset” playlist).<br/>Please note that I generally <em>do not</em> take on alteration projects, as I unfortunately don’t have as much time to sew these days, and shipping the corset back and forth to Canada (where I live) would likely be more expensive than buying a new OTR corset.</p>

<summary><span><strong>Do you make corsets too? Can I buy one from you?</strong></span></summary>
<p>Yes, I do make corsets! You can see examples of my work in my <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7FEBB0D146186F4B" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Corset Case Studies">Case Studies playlist</a>, and also in my <a href="https://lucycorsetry.com/for-sale/ordering-a-corset/gallery-of-past-work/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Gallery of past work">Gallery</a> (although neither have been updated in awhile because I haven’t had the time to sew lately). I was unfortunately in a car accident in 2014 that made it painful to sew, and I had to stop taking custom commissions, so now I outsource my designs to other manufacturers. I now have affordable, ready-to-wear corsets readily available for purchase. See my shop here (<a href="https://lucycorsetry.com/corsets/">best for desktop</a>) or here (<a href="https://lucycorsetry.com/shop.">best for mobile</a>).</p>

<summary><span><strong>Can you send me a free corset?</strong></span></summary>
<p>Unfortunately not. I’m an individual corset enthusiast and almost everything I earn after rent and bills goes back to my channel and reviewing corsets for my viewers! “Corset Samples” mentioned in the Bronze Line are not free samples; in reality they are usually one-of-a-kind/ one-off practice pieces, which may be discounted because they might not be perfect (but they are still fully functional). However, I do corset giveaways on Youtube and Facebook when I reach new milestones, so please <a href="http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=bishonenrancher" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Subscribe to Lucy (Bishonenrancher)">subscribe to my Youtube channel</a> and follow me on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/bishonenrancher" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Lucy on Facebook">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://instagram.com/lucycorsetry">Instagram</a> for your chance to win a free corset.</p>
