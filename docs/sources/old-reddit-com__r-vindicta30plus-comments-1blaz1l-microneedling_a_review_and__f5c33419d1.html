<h1>Microneedling: a review, and how do to that at home</h1>
<p><strong>r/vindicta30plus</strong> • by u/darthemofan • 0 points</p>
<div class='post-content'><div class="md"><p>Yesterday, someone asked about vampire facials: it's essentially PRP injections +- microneedling, but some places don't do the microneedling part (which is sad as it's very good by itself) because it takes time and it can be messy (there will be blood!)</p>
<p>Lately there's been lots of copes on the sub - and there are very valid ones, like some treatments being costly.</p>
<p>But if there's one that's not expansive, that you can do at home, that makes many promises, yet delivers on all of them, it's microneedling</p>
<p>So here's a small guide to help you get starting with looksmaxxing</p>
<h1>The science behind microneedling</h1>
<p>First, here is a link you should read if you haven't heard about microneedling before, or you are considering it, because it's important to check the science before doing anything: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Vindicta/comments/j8ms1k/microneedlingdermapen_what_can_it_do_litterature">https://www.reddit.com/r/Vindicta/comments/j8ms1k/microneedlingdermapen_what_can_it_do_litterature</a></p>
<p>Compared to other procedures, what's good is that it's possible (and much cheaper!) to do it at home. Some people also do PRP at home, but I don't recommend that: you need experience drawing blood, with vacuum tubes, iv lines, and a centrifuge.  In theory, it's possible but there are a few things that could go wrong. It's not that you can't do it well if you absolutely want to, but doing microneedling is much safer</p>
<h1>The first time</h1>
<p>If you have the money, get your first microneedling done by a professional, just to see what it entails. </p>
<p>If you can't get it done by a pro, you can try it at home with a patch test (ex: back of your arm) before risking it on your face</p>
<h1>What you need</h1>
<ul>
<li>A dr pen (amazon has that) + a tip. Don't reuse the tips: use it once, then trash it</li>
<li>70% alcohol</li>
<li>lidocaine cream (a few tubes)</li>
<li>saran wrap</li>
<li>tretinoin</li>
<li>scissors with a round tip</li>
<li>paper towels</li>
<li>gloves</li>
<li>being currently healthy: not having an actual skin infection or cold sores</li>
</ul>
<h1>How to do it</h1>
<p>Ideally right before a long weekend, desinfect you whole face with 70% alcohol. Apply lidocaine cream all over, and make it THICK: you face should be white. If you can see the skin through the cream, it's not enough. Add some more. You'll need at least 2 or 3 tubes. The more concentrated the lidocaine, the better: some shops sell high % lidocaine for "tatoos". I can recommend alibaba and aliexpress</p>
<p>Then apply something to "hold the lidocaine cream in place" as gravity will make it leak otherwise: I'm a big fan of saran wrap: I just run it around my face, cutting holes for my mouth, nostril and eyes. I wrap my whole head like that</p>
<p>Make sure you can breathe: if not use the scissors and try again lol</p>
<p>Then wait at least 45 minutes for top efficiency of the lidocaine (and less pain!)</p>
<p>Another way is to use a k-beauty mask (because it has premade holes) instead of the saran wrap, but it leaks more, I don't like that</p>
<h1>Set your pen</h1>
<p>There are different protocols depending on what you want to do: use 1.5mm for scars, 0.5mm for wrinkles. There are many other protocols: if you've read the links, you will know what to use!</p>
<p>You should also use different depths for different parts of your face - but I won't tell you precisely what, bc if you don't know, that means you haven't read the links, and I don't want to encourage anyone to take too many risks</p>
<h1>Remove the cream and desinfect again</h1>
<p>Cut out the saran wrap (or unroll it), remove the lidocaine with paper towels, desinfect again, then let the alcohol dry out a bit. Don't feel rushed: you have between 30min to 1hour during which you won't feel pain</p>
<h1>The actual microneedling</h1>
<p>Use alcohol on your gloves, then microneedle your face with the right settings (!)</p>
<p>It's best to be in front of a mirror to avoid forgetting zones. You can do multiple passes on problematic areas like scars </p>
<p>And if you have specific problems, now is the time to use your actives and make them go deeper:</p>
<ul>
<li>for hairloss, put a drop of minoxidil, microneedle it! even better if you also have latisse, as they are synergestic</li>
<li>for melasma, same with tranxemic acid or vitamin C</li>
<li>there are many others actives... do your research!</li>
</ul>
<h1>Wrapping it up</h1>
<p>Your face will be bleeding. That's when I usually use almost half a tube of tretinoin gel 0.1%: both because it's greasy and limits the bleeding, and because it's tret and it's good for the skin</p>
<p>I put a towel on my pillow, pop some sleeping pills, and sleep it out. The next day, there will be crusts, but don't touch them. Let you face heal. </p>
<p>When you <em>have</em> to go back to work on monday, wash your face gently with a soap like cerave. Don't dry it out with a towel, but with an hair drier, to limit the risks of infections (towels are full of microbes)</p>
<p>You may look red, but nobody will be able to guess you looked like the main character of an horror movie a few days before :)</p>

<p>a professional is not magical: it's just someone who gets paid for their services. it doesn't mean they perform good services.</p>
<p>have you ever had microneedling done by a pro?</p>
<p>have you noticed them do anything different that what I suggested here?</p>
<p>I have been to a few pros, and a few times I've noticed differences:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>they don't care as much ab the hygiene, in almost every case forgetting the 2nd disinfection</p></li>
<li><p>they don't care as much ab your pain either: by using no lidocaine and telling you to take a tylenol, not applying it the lidocaine for long enough, or not using proper occlusion to avoid evaporation or leakage</p></li>
<li><p>they forget to change their gloves or at least to disinfect again when taking a phonecall</p></li>
<li><p>once done, they put a weird cheap cream on your face to stop the bleeding, often from a tube that's not brand new, and containing no active</p></li>
</ul>
<p>However, you raise 1 valid concern: the risk of infection.</p>
<p>If after desinfecting your face twice you are still afraid ab infection, go to a pet store or order from a prepper website: get yourself amoxicillin  (like the fishmox brand) at 500mg 2 pills 3 times a day for 5 days it will nip in the bud most infections</p>
<p>You will see if you need amox on the day when you wash out all the crust, but your "professional" at a spa wont tell you ab that, and if <em>they</em> messed up, they will just tell you to go to see a doc (at your own expense, and it'll cost you way more than a bottle of fishmox)</p>
<p>just FYI, after doing microneedling at home  more than a few times for the last 3 years (look at the date when I first posted the guide on Vindicta) I can't remember needing amoxicillin even once</p>
<p>BTW may I ask you why you bash ali express lidocaine? It's more concentrated (so more efficient, so you need less) and cheaper that what's sold OTC in the US.</p>
<p>Maybe I'm reading too much between the lines, but your comment makes me think ab classism.</p>
<p>There was a time I was poor, like rly poor. I certainly couldn't have afforded a professional. I didn't even have health insurance lol.</p>
<p>I haven't forgotten that time. there are ppl on this sub who may not have the hundreds of dollars it would take to go to a pro, but they can afford to spend less than $100 to get all the things and do microneedling at home, as often as they want to (but I suggest not overdoing it: check the scientific litterature, and follow their protocol)</p>
<p>Now that I can offer the service of pros. I'd rather keep doing my microneedling at home, bc I think that's better too: I won't cheap out on the lidocaine, the actives, or take shortcuts in the desinfection protocols</p>

                <div class="md"><p>girl be so for real, it’s not classist to advise that people proceed with caution when performing a procedure on themselves that trained professionals can sometimes botch. if it’s worked for you, awesome, live your best life. personally i think suggesting people buy random odds and ends from amazon and ali express to poke holes in their own skin, and take fish medication if there’s an infection, is bootleg as fuck. </p>
<p>i’m not here to gatekeep, i understand different people have different income levels. but it’s not always practical to cut corners for certain things because you often get what you paid for, like inexpensive tattoos, and can result in spending more money to correct the cheaper procedure.</p>

<p>that's super loaded words. its not random, it's precise </p>
<blockquote>
<p>take fish medication if there’s an infection</p>
</blockquote>
<p>if you have a friendly doctor willing to prescribe you amox, go for it</p>
<p>then do a nice experiment: compare the shape, color and writing on the pills you got from your doctor to fishmox.</p>
<p>it's the same... bc it comes from the same factory.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>yes it's bootleg, but since my previous advice was met with criticism of being too expansive, I've tried to suggest something far less expansive, that almost anyone can do (you need 2 hands, and to be able to see yourself in the mirror without wearing glasses)</p>

<p>some ppl prefer natural healing, that's fine - I've had some free bleeding sessions, where I just let the blood crust</p>

<p>I'd say it depends on your pain tolerance. I don't like pain so I default to it</p>

<p>I'd recommend not going outside while healing. No sunscreen, no nothing on the skin. Let it heal until you've got to go back to work</p>

<p>fair enough - it's something I incorporated after a few tries, little by little, and after checking refs, but rn I can swear it works just fine (at least with transparent tret gels).. and I've been doing that for over 3 years</p>
<p>but be careful don't microneedle everything and anything in (only exception: stuff that can be injected or put into your eyes, like latisse eyedrops), if you want to do that, at least do a patchtest</p>
<p>but once the microneedling is done, you can apply things</p>
<blockquote>

<p>It's not just for the active: the gel limits the bleeding. but it's also the opportunity to have a higher penetration that usual. it won't be sky high (bc of the bleeding) and the #1 consequence (peeling/"purging") won't be noticeable bc you'll leave your skin as-is for the next few days</p>
<p>Also, it's a way to not stop my normal daily tret: I won't be able to do it every day until I wash the crusts away, but I will have applied a large dose so I will not have a rebound effect with extra peeling when I resume tret</p>
<p>Check the references I posted: it's not necessary to stop tret for microneedling: 
    <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4924407/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4924407/</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The present established standard preoperative surgical care, so far advises the stoppage of oral isotretinoin 6–12 months before any dermatosurgery.[7] This was based on the early reports of keloids or delayed wound healing, in patients on isotretinoin during surgery documented in 1980's.[8,9] Surprisingly, this recommendation stemmed from 9 cases reported from different authors</p>
<p>However in 1985, Roenigk et al. had performed dermabrasion in nine patients on isotretinoin and reported normal “initial” skin healing.[10] However, despite this observation, for nearly two decades, stopping oral isotretinoin before dermatosurgery was the medico-legal standard practice, unchallenged.</p>
<p>The only microneedling case enrolled and subjected to 7 sessions of therapy had pigmentation which resolved.</p>
<p>Of interest, in this prospective interventional study – “102 Fractional Er: YAG laser resurfacing, 19 conventional full face CO2 laser resurfacing, 19 Fractional CO2 laser resurfacing, 8 skin biopsies;” had no keloid/hypertrophic scar formation or delayed healing. All the above were collagen-specific interventions</p>
<p>However, there were minor reversible outcomes such as pigmentation, erythema, and acne. If one compares our study and literature, which could serve like control data, the occurrence of reversible events in isotretinoin group is comparable</p>
<p>This study with 504 interventions done in patients taking oral isotretinoin with – glycolic/salicylic/combination acid peels, fractional Er: YAG laser resurfacing/fractional CO2 laser and conventional CO2 laser resurfacing, microdermabrasion had a single documented keloid in glycolic peel group. This was probably idiosyncratic. The second case of keloid following radiofrequency ablation of compound nevi however could not be explained.</p>
<p>The results of this study, further enhance the already accumulating evidence, about the safety of procedures in patients receiving isotretinoin and further provide additional evidence that the current recommendations for avoiding procedures may not be valid and need revision.</p>

                <div class="md"><p>While this may work for you personally, microneedling at home is such a dangerous idea. While you may be doing it at home successfully, posting instructions for other inexperienced people to recreate this in their home feels irresponsible and dangerous. I know you have good intentions but this is really not safe advice. Microneedling can send you to the hospital if not done by someone who is properly trained and ensuring everything is sterile. </p>
<p>I’ve had microneedling done 3x by a cosmetic dermatologist and had great results. It’s great for treating acne scars and stimulating collagen. But after hearing about horror stories from my doctor and the internet, this is not something you want to cut corners on. At best your results won’t be nearly as good as what a doctor can provide, and at worst you’ll end up in the hospital.</p>

<p>I disagree with that take, because I've build up experience, and I'm not tied by a clock, while a pro has to finish you in the scheduled time to take the next client, and sometimes may cut corners. I've noticed that (mostly for electro)</p>
<p>as for the fear mongering about hospitals, I've got antibiotics</p>

<p>not in my experience, it didn't change anything for the worse. I was mostly worried ab having to stop tret for a few days (bc I don't apply anything to my face while it's healing)</p>

<p>watch yt videos and read other tutorials, but for like $200 you'll get a top of the line dermapen. add another $100 and you'll have all the consumables to last you at least 1 to 2 years. lidocaine and fishmox are the most expansive, if you can get them prescribed by your doc you may save money</p>

<p>if you use it on the bleeding skin in the end, it's unlikely to go into the skin, but I like to play it safe: the only things I microneedle into my skin is what I've patch tested before, or things that are made to go in the eyes or into the veins (ex: latisse eyedrops, peptides)</p>

<p>were you using the small brush/pencil?</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>ABSOLUTELY! A change in eye color would freak me out! I've spent good money to get blue eyes instead of the brown eyes I was born with (it's a long story...), so even if I'd like longer lashes I'm very weary of latisse now! I won't even use castor oil!</p>
<p>But the darkness around your eyes puzzles me. TBH it's the first time I've ever heard that on a while person not from the middle east - and with red hair, your body can't produce eumelanin on the skin, only pheomelanin, so it's very weird.</p>
<p>I don't think it's pigmentary: it's more likely to be vascular, by reduction of the fat pad around the eye (especially if you've had cancer + treatment) another possible side effect of latisse</p>
<p>Do you still have the darkness? Are you looking for solutions?</p>
<p>If it's due to fat loss, you may need nanofat transplant + PRP. In fact, that's what I'd try by default bc there're lots of easy solution for pigmentary  (I'm into skin whitening... I know a few), but not so many for fat loss</p>
<p>In any case, lmk if there's anything I can do to help</p>

                <div class="md"><p>Yes. I used the brush.  But I used all of that BEFORE cancer. Years before. Such an ugly little side effect. </p>
<p>I am in remission now.  However, the chemo caused me to have a pulmonary embolism and a DVT (right at the end of six rounds). THAT was a nightmare! I had to be in the hospital for that, I am now on blood thinners for life-because chemo, well, it is the gift that keeps giving. I remained on a form of intravenous chemo for another 15 months after that. But that is okay!! I mention that because the thinners make nanofat transplant + PRP dicey at best. </p>
<p>The discoloration is honestly like purple eyeshadow lining my upper and lower lash lines.  I’m fine most of the time because I don’t out a lot. If I go out, I wear some eye makeup that covers it and it is fine. But truthfully, I go about my life in the world without anything on my face 75% of the time (well, you know, I do wear sunscreen) because I do not care if people look at me strangely.  I went out without any hair, no wigs. I clearly care and don’t care all at the same time. I was very vain and remain vain. But I know my limitations and what I feel is necessary for me in life. IF I were a young person I would probably look for solutions to this issue.  I am not. </p>
<p>Funny thing about my hair (the good “Irish” hair-auburn, curly, long and beautiful), it fell out, so did my brows, lashes, body hair. When it came back it is not the same color at all-it is brown and silver in the front.  The density and curl pattern are not the same. I have, at least for now, chosen not to grow it back out. It is short. I don’t love it. But it will never be as it was.  I do not have the patience to wait it out. I tried already and failed. I am 31 months in remission. If it was going to get better, it would have by now.  I’m not going to cry over it. I’m just going to live my life and pray that the cancer doesn’t return.  (Good luck to me-this is a rare ovarian cancer. Most do not survive this.  So I am doing fantastic!!). Well, that was a long answer for no reason to a stranger. Mainly just for clarity.  You are kind to make suggestions. Thank you.</p>

<p>yes, you could get extra bleeding there and that'd be bad (like just diplopia: I had double vison for month after browbone FFS surgery, I had to close an eye if I wanted to read anything, and I wasn't even on thinners...)</p>
<p>also if you do some fat transplant, you'd need to wear compressive stockings in the donor area to limit the risk of hematoma, which is increased by blood thinners.</p>
<p>you're in a tough situation. it's rare that I say smtg like that, but I would suggest doing nothing surgically beyond at best PRP - maybe just Zhi Mu or Volufiline topicals (bc I can't see how stimulating local fat gains could have negative side effects even now that I have the full picture of the situation!) but nothing more</p>

                <div class="md"><p>I absolutely agree that micro needling is something you can do at home. This I good preliminary advice but with everyone people have to use caution, do their research, and make sure it’s something they are willing to. There’s a whole diy community out there. Hell, people are injecting filler into their own face. Not saying it’s right but people do it.</p>
<p>I think getting microbeedling done at an office is a waste of money. I also agree that just because someone is educated to do something doesn’t mean they do it right. I got microbeedling done once but someone who was an aesthetician for 20 years and she not only double booked me knowing this was my first time getting it done but left the numbing on too long that by the time I sat in her chair it wore off and it was extremely painful. I will never let a so called professional do that ever again. It’s not dangerous advice just because you are too afraid to do it.</p>

<p>unfortunately, that seems to be the minority opinion on the sub, given how downvoted it was. It may have frightened the normies lol</p>

<p>good preliminary advice but with everyone people have to use caution, do their research</p>

<p>I left out some details about the needles and the depth to incite people to read the links and do their research</p>

<p>Hell, people are injecting filler into their own face. Not saying it’s right but people do it.</p>

<p>Personally, that's were I draw the line. I wouldn't recommend self injections, because it's hard to control the angle, the depth and the amount injected at the same time.</p>
<p>Even if it's say on my leg, I'm not a big fan of self injections</p>

<p>by the time I sat in her chair it wore off and it was extremely painful. </p>

<p>I'm very sorry it happened to you :-( </p>
<p>My rules of thumb with a professional: </p>
<ul>
<li>I will apply my lidocaine myself, in the amount I think is appropriate</li>
<li>I will never let it dry out, and always use saran wrap. If I look like a freak with saran wrap around my head, so be it. I'm paying for the service.</li>
<li>I will cut out the saran wrap when I'm in the actual room, with the professional present and ready, and not in the waiting room in case they run late</li>
</ul>
<p>The last one is the most important: they want the saran wrap to be cut earlier to save time and be able to take more patients or breaks between patients? it's a nice concern to have, but I care about my pain more than I care about their profits or their coffee break. They are free to charge me extra if they want</p>

<p>I will never let a so called professional do that ever again. </p>

<p>ABSOLUTELY</p>
<p>I go to a pro for PRP, but I still apply my basic rules bc I don't want to suffer</p>

<p>some ppl are afraid of arrythmia, while this has only been noticed on large areas (ex: the full back) of damaged skin (tatoo sessions) of people with preexisting heart problems IIRC.</p>
<p>the face is a small surface, the skin is intact -  I go for it bc I dont like pain</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>ok, so what's the worst that can happen from too much tret? peeling a lot, bc it increases turnover.</p>
<p>consider how my face looks like for the next 2 days it's a non issue</p>
