<h1>How to Waist Train: Comparing Corset Training Methods</h1>
<html><body><div><div class="entry-content single-page">
<p><span>In previous articles, I’ve talked quite a bit about waist training, but I’ve never actually focused on the different methods at length. Just as there is more than one path to physical fitness or other physical goals, there are also different methods of waist training. This article will outline the two most popular waist training methods, and their pros/ cons as I tried them for myself.</span></p>
<p><span>(Always check with your doctor before wearing corsets for any reason, and should you decide to take up waist training, remember to have your health monitored throughout your journey.) </span></p>

I started with the Roller Coaster Method.</figcaption></figure>
<h2></h2>
<p><span>In my very first waist training video, I mentioned that this is the method I started with. The “roller coaster” method was developed by Ann Grogan, president of Romantasy Exquisite Corsetry and waist training advisor for nearly 25 years.</span></p>
<p><span>Grogan outlines her roller coaster method of waist training in her manual, <a href="http://romantasyweb.com/Merchant2/merchant.mv?Screen=PROD&amp;Product_Code=book01&amp;Category_Code=moc" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Corset Magic</em></a> (you can watch my overview of the book <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbGLRTfMTU4" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>) but for those who need more guidance, she also offers personalized <a href="http://romantasyweb.com/Merchant2/merchant.mv?Screen=PROD&amp;Store_Code=R&amp;Product_Code=3-month++Waist-Training+Plan+-+Corset+Wear&amp;Category_Code=scc" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">waist training plans</a> and <a href="http://romantasyweb.com/Merchant2/merchant.mv?Screen=PROD&amp;Store_Code=R&amp;Product_Code=3-Month+Waist-Training+-+Coaching+Program&amp;Category_Code=scc" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">full 3-month waist training programs</a>.</span></p>
<p><span>The roller coaster method can be a bit strict – it relies on you maintaining a specific waist reduction, for a certain duration of time, for a certain number of days. For instance, let’s say that your natural waist is 30” and you’re wearing the corset at 28 inches (a 2-inch reduction over the corset). You would start just by wearing your corset for a couple of hours each day, until your corset is seasoned.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Once you are ready, you can increase your wear by another couple of hours per day (so you’re wearing the corset for 4 hours each day instead of only 2) for several days or a week. Once you feel comfortable with that, you can once again increase your wear for several more hours per day – being mindful to always remain at 28 inches and slowly building up your tolerance for longer durations of time.</span></li>
<li><span>Once you’re able to wear your corset for over 8 hours or all day at that 28 inch measurement, you can tighten your corset just a little bit, but also <em>drop your hours back down</em> so you’re cinched in tighter, but wearing the corset for a shorter duration of time.</span></li>
<li><span>Just like before, over the course of days and weeks, you can slowly build up your tolerance for longer hours at that restriction. When you’re ready, tighten your corset just a tiny bit more but then drop your hours down again. Grogan has a sample outline of this method on her website on <a href="http://romantasyweb.com/Merchant2/merchant.mv?Screen=PROD&amp;Store_Code=R&amp;Product_Code=3-month++Waist-Training+Plan+-+Corset+Wear&amp;Category_Code=scc" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>this page</span></a>, for you to view freely.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>This method of waist training requires you to watch the clock carefully, and to also monitor your reduction daily or multiple times a day, using a tape measure over the corset. If you need a really concrete instructional guide for waist training and you enjoy structure and discipline, you will probably appreciate the Roller Coaster method.</span></p>

<h2></h2>
<p><span>This waist training method was first outlined by Fran Blanche, owner of Contour Corsets. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160214010227/http://contourcorsets.com/tightlacing_tips.html#thecyclemethod" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The cycle method</a></span> <span>is less strict and scheduled compared to the roller coaster method, and is described as more intuitive and ‘zen’ by those who use it.</span></p>
<p><span>It takes into consideration the fact that your body is not always stable; it’s in a constant state of flux – your natural waist measurement can change by several inches over the course of a day just from water retention, what you eat, your menstrual cycle (if you have one), your stress levels and more. And t</span><span>hese factors <a href="https://lucycorsetry.com/2014/05/26/waist-training-how-long-before-i-see-results/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="WAIST TRAINING: How long before I see results?">can all affect how much you’re able to comfortably lace down</a> on a given day or even a given time of day. Because of this, it may feel more intuitive to lace down more on days and times that you’re able to tolerate this greater restriction, and lace down less on days and times that you need more space.</span></p>
<p><span>In other words, if the corset feels too loose, tighten it. If the corset feels too tight, loosen it. And some people may find that they need to loosen or tighten the corset many times throughout the day – there is nothing inherently wrong with this.</span></p>
<p><span>Fran says that with consistent wear (even when cycling your pressures), a waist trainer may find that over a long period of time, their ‘average’ waist measurement will reduce, even if it may not feel like it by having to vary the measurements slightly every day.</span></p>
<p><span>Here, the exact number of your waist to the half-inch is not as important as your overall comfort level – but the cycle method also somewhat implies that the trainer is wearing the corset for longer hours each day compared to the roller coaster method (which tends to aim for a duration of 2-8 hours a day).</span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<h2><span>How many hours a day is best when it comes to waist training?</span></h2>
<p><span>This answer is different for everybody. Some people are able to see quick results in a corset with fewer hours put in, and some people have slower results even when wearing their corset all day. Of course, when we’re talking about “results”, not all of us <a href="https://lucycorsetry.com/2013/10/13/waist-training-vs-tight-lacing-whats-the-difference/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Waist Training vs Tight Lacing – what’s the difference?">waist train for the same reasons</a> or <a href="https://lucycorsetry.com/2013/10/20/setting-waist-training-goals-focusing-on-proportion/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Setting waist training goals – focusing on proportion">have the same goals</a>.</span></p>
<p><span>But many experienced waist trainers will agree that <strong>the length of time that you wear a corset is a <em>bit</em> more important than the actual reduction</strong>. If you are able to wear your corset at a 3-4 reduction comfortably all day, this will likely be more comfortable and more productive for your waist training compared to wearing a corset at a 6-7 inch reduction for only 1 hour and having to remove it to recuperate for the next couple of days (this is effectively overlacing). The latter scenario could set you up for discomfort, injury, it may lead to you having to take unwanted time off to regroup – and it also may lead to you associating the corset with pain and negative experiences, which is the exact opposite of what a waist trainer should experience.</span></p>
<p><span>Some people aim for wearing their corset for a specific number of hours each day. The <strong>Romantasy roller coaster method suggests 8 hours a day, 6 days a week</strong> as a good duration to strive for. In order to break my 22-inch plateau, I found <strong>I had to corset for about 12 hours a day</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>Some people wear their corsets <strong>during waking hours</strong> (they put on their corsets when they get up in the morning, and take off their corset when getting ready for bed) – which may be in the range of 16 hours a day.</span></p>
<p><span>Others may do the opposite and only wear their corset <strong>during sleeping hours</strong> – they may not wear their corset during the day, but they cinch their waist when getting ready to sleep, and so they unconsciously get 8 hours in per day.</span></p>
<p><span>Some very dedicated trainers will wear their corset <strong>23 hours a day</strong> – reserving one hour per day for bathing and exercising – often trainers will have to work their way up to this lifestyle over the course of months or years, because jumping into a 23/7 waist training regime can be a drastic change in lifestyle: all the things you did before without your corset, you would have to adjust to doing it with a corset, eliminate activities that are not compatible, or substitute some things that are more compatible. </span><strong><span>I do not recommend the 23/7 method for beginners,</span></strong><span> nor do I believe that a 23/7 lifestyle is really necessary for any waist trainer except under extenuating circumstances (like if they are going after the world record).</span></p>
<p><span>And it’s worth mentioning that sometimes the results from the 23/7 method are not worth the challenges that come with them. Heidi, aka <a href="http://straitlaceddame.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Straight-Laced Dame</a>/ <a href="http://corsetathlete.tumblr.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Corset Athlete</a>, has written a <a href="http://straitlaceddame.com/2/post/2014/02/time-spent-in-a-corset-what-is-just-right-for-you.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">fantastic article</a> which compares your enjoyment/ comfort level while wearing a corset, with the effectiveness of your training – and finding that “sweet spot” where you get your highest return on investment.</span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<h2><span><b>Which Method of Waist Training is Best?</b></span></h2>
<p><span>I can’t tell you which waist training method is best for you, as I said before – we all have different bodies, different schedules and different goals. But myself, having tried both the Romantasy Roller Coaster method and the Contour Corsets Cycle method, <strong>I found that the Roller Coaster method gave me what I was looking for in the beginning,</strong> when I was still relatively new at corseting – back when I needed technical, straightforward, step-by-step guidance on wearing a corset.</span></p>
<p><span>Slowly building up my hours over many weeks and months at a time helped to teach me how my body is supposed to feel during the process of waist training, and how it’s <em>not</em> supposed to feel. I used the roller coaster method to successfully train down the first 5 or so inches of reduction.</span></p>
<p><span>Of course (as with most other forms of training!) I eventually reached a plateau. I had a hard time lacing past about 22″ comfortably for long periods of time. I sort of felt myself a failure at that point because I wasn’t advancing with the same speed I was before. Not wanting to risk pain or injury, after some time off and some research, I invested in a <a href="https://lucycorsetry.com/2013/10/02/a-personal-blog-my-quest-for-the-elusive-perfect-corset/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="A ‘Personal’ Blog: My quest for the elusive “Perfect Corset”">number of better fitting corsets</a> and also<strong> found myself gravitating more to the Cycle method</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>The Cycle method allowed me to be a bit less hard on myself if I didn’t meet a certain goal within a certain time, because I was no longer focusing on time. The method respected the limitations of my body and the signals it was giving me. It felt healthier – like I was allowed to be more gentle with myself, while still presenting enough of a challenge to see progress and advancement if I chose.</span></p>
<p><span>And I began enjoying wearing my corset again – it allowed me to take my eyes off the clock, to stop measuring my waist circumference every day, and to just enjoy the feeling of being in a corset – the posture support and the feeling of being hugged, my silhouette under a vintage gown, and the empowerment of wearing a form of armor. This method reminded me <a href="https://lucycorsetry.com/2012/05/09/enjoying-the-journey-and-adjusting-goals/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Enjoying the Corseting Journey and Adjusting Goals">to enjoy the journey</a>, as opposed to being unhealthily and impatiently focused on the destination.</span></p>
<p><em><span>In this article I touched on just a few different methods of waist training. I encourage you to do a little of your own research into waist training and to find the one that you find the one that feels most safe and comfortable for you. If you waist train, leave me a comment below and me know which method works best for you, or which methods you’ve tried in the past!</span></em></p>
