<h1>Corset Training Infodump </h1>
<p><strong>r/4tran4</strong> • by u/Wonderful-Low7905 • 104 points</p>
<div class='post-content'><div class="md"><p>Hello <em>{insert affectionate term for trans people that isn't a slur}</em>, it is I, the 4tran puppygirl's partner (she calls me "mom" on here). As penance for being a theyfab, I would like to make what is (hopefully) a useful post on corset training. I understand that this is something many trans women are interested in, and there is a lot of misinformation going around, so I would like to do my part to help clear some of it up.</p>
<p>Credentials: I am autistic and corsets are one of my special interests. I have corset trained on a daily basis for over a year. I have also helped puppygirl corset train early on in her transition. I've done hundreds of hours of research on this topic, but I should include a disclaimer that I am not a registered expert on anything at all.</p>
<p>Okay, let's get into it.</p>
<hr/>
<h1>What Is Corset Training?</h1>
<p>Corset training, also commonly referred to as waist training and sometimes referred to as "tightlacing," is the practice of wearing an anatomically patterned, steel-boned corset for multiple hours a day (or night) on a consistent basis for an extended period of time in order to either a) reduce the size of one's natural waist or b) reduce the size of one's corseted waist.</p>
<p>I draw a distinction between the natural waist and the corseted waist for an important reason. Namely, if you corset train properly, I <em>can</em> guarantee that you will reduce the size of your corseted waist (i.e. be able to gradually size down into smaller and smaller corsets). I <em>cannot</em>, however, guarantee that you will reduce the size of your natural waist (your waist when you aren't wearing a corset). It is <em>likely</em> that you will see a modest reduction in the size of your natural waist, but I don't want to give anyone unrealistic expectations.</p>
<h1>How Does Corset Training Work?</h1>
<p>Corset training is a semi-permanent form of body modification (more on the "semi-permanent" side of things in the "What Are the Results of Corset Training?" section below) that works by gradually compressing (and sometimes slightly shifting) adipose tissue between the high hip and lower floating ribs (you can sometimes also compress the lower floating ribs--more on this in the "What Is Rib Training?" section below). In some cases, corset training can also slightly shift internal organs, though not to a significant degree.</p>
<p>Basically, you  squeeze certain parts of your body for long periods of time, and over the course of weeks/months it becomes easier to squeeze those parts, allowing you to squeeze them even more.</p>
<h1>Is Corset Training Safe?</h1>
<p>When done correctly, probably. When done incorrectly, no.</p>
<p>There has been almost zero scientific research done on modern-day corset training. Most of the research that <em>has</em> been done either focuses on historical corsets (which are different than modern-day corsets in a whole bunch of ways that I won't bore you with) or fails to account for all the essential variables (such as the corset shape and anatomy of the individual wearer). So, I can't give you any sort of scientific proof that corset training is safe.</p>
<p>What I can give you is a bunch of anecdotal experiences that people (myself and puppygirl included) have had with corset training. I've been very active in online corset communities, and I have yet to see anyone discuss any permanent negative side effects they have experienced from corset training.</p>
<p>HOWEVER, I really, really want to stress the importance of doing this the right way. You need to make sure you purchase a corset that is made with high-quality steel boning, is anatomically patterned, and is suitable for your individual body type. You also need to make sure you wear the corset properly. I'll break these factors down:</p>
<p><strong>1. High-quality steel boning</strong></p>
<p>Corset training works via compression, so the boning in your corset needs to be able to stand up well to this force. Plastic boning is often found in fashion corsets, which are fine to wear if you don't lace them very tightly (just wear them over your clothes as a decorative item), but are very much so not fine to use to actually compress your waist.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, some less reputable manufacturers have learned that people seek out steel boning in corsets, so in order to sell more items, they've replaced their plastic boning with cheap, low-quality steel. This is almost even more dangerous than plastic boning because if it does snap on you, suddenly having a long piece of steel digging into your side will hurt a lot more than suddenly having a long piece of plastic digging into your side. The worse case scenario for both plastic and low-quality steel boning is nerve damage caused by the bones snapping or bending.</p>
<p><strong>2. Anatomical patterning</strong></p>
<p>There are certain parts of your body that are okay to compress and certain parts that aren't. Compressing fat is fine; compressing bone is bad. Corsets need to be patterned in such a way so that they put compressive force only on the specific parts of the body where it is safe to do so. When you tighten your corset, you should feel pressure on your squishy middle bits but not on your ribs (see small caveat in the "What Is Rib Training?" section below) or your hips.</p>
<p>So, people who make corset patterns need to have a solid understanding of human anatomy as well as of physics. They need to be very intentional about where the compressive force is applied. It is not at all enough to simply make something in the general shape of a corset and call it a day (but unfortunately, many companies--I'm looking at you Orchard Corsets--do exactly that).</p>
<p><strong>3. Suitable for your body type</strong></p>
<p>Even if a corset is made with high-quality steel boning and is anatomically patterned, it still may not be safe to wear if it doesn't match your individual body type. The distance between your waist and your hips is different than the difference between someone else's waist and hips. The difference between your high hip and low rib measurements isn't the same as someone else's. This is why reputable corset brands will offer a wide range of silhouettes to accommodate for different body types (more on this in the "How Can You Measure Yourself for a Corset?" section below).</p>
<p><strong>4. Worn correctly</strong></p>
<p>To make a long story short, you need to put the corset on correctly, season it correctly, and wear it for the correct amount of time. You can read more about this in the "How Do You Put on a Corset?," " How Do You Season a Corset," and "When Should You Wear Your Corset?" sections below.</p>
<h1>Is Corset Training Painful?</h1>
<p><strong>NO.</strong> If it is, you're doing something wrong and should take the corset off right away. Wearing a corset for the purposes of corset training should feel like a tight hug. You should feel some compression, but it should not be uncomfortable, and it should certainly never be painful.</p>
<p>Never try to "push through" the pain when corset training. Doing so can cause serious damage. If something feels painful, take the corset off right away. A corset that fits you well and is worn properly will never hurt.</p>
<h1>Is Corset Training a Weight Loss Strategy?</h1>
<p>Probably not. If "skinny" is your goal, then corset training isn't necessarily the best strategy. It will most likely shift the adipose tissue on your waist downwards, which can create the appearance of an apron belly. This isn't necessarily a <em>bad</em> thing as it is a feminine fat distribution pattern, but corsets aren't a magic make-you-skinny pill.</p>
<p>Anecdotally, some people find that if they gain weight while consistently corset training, they tend to put more weight on their hips and less on their waist. However, there isn't any scientific evidence for this. It may be true or it may not.</p>
<h1>Is Corset Training a Good Idea for Trans Girls?</h1>
<p>Sure. Maybe. It depends on what your goals are.</p>
<p>If you want something that will act as a very powerful piece of shapewear to give you a more hourglass shape while you're wearing it, then corsets are a great option. If you want something that will permanently change your waist measurement even when you aren't wearing the corset, then it's a bit more iffy (more on this in the "What Are the Results of Corset Training?" section below).</p>
<p>If you're dysphoric about your waist, corset training can almost definitely help. If you're dysphoric about your ribcage, corset training can <em>maybe</em> help (more on this in the "What Is Rib Training" section). If you're dysphoric about your shoulder width, corset training can actually be useful (especially when combined with hip padding). By creating a more extreme hip-to-waist ratio, you can slightly offset the appearance of broad shoulders in an optical illusion type way.</p>
<p>I would, however, advise you not to wear your corset overtop of your clothing when in public (you can totally wear it under clothing though--more on this in the "How Do You Stealth a Corset" section). For some reason, corsets really set transvestigators off. I used to have a pretty active social media presence where I shared photos of me wearing corsets, and it was not terribly uncommon for me to get comments accusing me of being trans. I'm afab with a pear-shaped body type and narrow shoulders, so if it happened to me, it could probably happen to you (unless you mog me, which tbh some of you likely do). I didn't get comments accusing me of being trans on photos or videos where the corset wasn't visible, so I do just think that it's the corset that sets them off for whatever reason.</p>
<h1>What Are the Results of Corset Training?</h1>
<p>As I said earlier, if you corset train properly, I can guarantee that you will reduce the size of your corseted waist (i.e. be able to gradually size down into smaller and smaller corsets). I cannot, however, guarantee that you will reduce the size of your natural waist (your waist when you aren't wearing a corset). It is likely that you will see a modest reduction in the size of your natural waist, but it's not a guarantee.</p>
<p>I hesitate to give concrete measurements because your mileage may vary, but I know it's what the people want so I'll do my best. Here are some rough estimates at the amount of reduction you might expect:</p>
<table><thead>
<tr>
<th align="left">high body fat percentage</th>
<th align="left">low body fat percentage</th>
</tr>
</thead><tbody>
<tr>
<td align="left">corseted waist</td>
<td align="left">7-14 inches</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">natural waist</td>
<td align="left">1-3 inches</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>These results are most likely semi-permanent and will fade over a period of months once you stop corset training. However, if your bones have not yet fused, you might get to keep your results more permanently. Even if your bones have already fused, it's possible that HRT (estrogen specifically) can make them more flexible, which could potentially make your results more permanent.</p>
<h1>What Is Rib Training?</h1>
<p>I said earlier that corset training works by compressing (and potentially slightly migrating) adipose (fat) tissue. If you want to take a more aggressive approach with your corset training, you can also work on rib training, which can slowly cause your lower floating ribs to turn inwards, creating the appearance of a smaller ribcage. You aren't actually altering your bones at all--you're just helping the cartilage connecting the lower floating ribs to become more flexible.</p>
<p>Rib training is something that starts later on in your corset training journey once you have already achieved at least a 4-6 inch reduction in your corseted waist. If rib training is your goal, you want a <strong>conical</strong> or <strong>straight-rib</strong> corset. A picture is worth a thousand words, so I'll show you what I mean:</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/2a00jfrewpjd1.jpg?width=600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9912fb8ed37c63caec09ef4f4a09d41510518825">cupped/round rib corset--not good for rib training</a></p>
<p>The corset above is what you <em>don't</em> want for rib training. As you can see, the corset forms a cupped shape as it tapers in at the waist. Cupped/round rib corsets are more comfortable to wear because they more closely match natural human anatomy, but they won't do anything for your lower floating ribs.</p>
<p>One upside to cupped/round rib corsets (besides the fact that they're more comfortable) is that they tend to make your waist appear smaller. Because they tapper in at the waist more quickly than conical/straight rib corsets, the difference between your ribcage and waist will appear more striking, which will make the waist seem smaller.</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/3nu4pzfiwpjd1.jpg?width=600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=286818c6f3c9850fd0d5d53d88aed80d94400fec">conical/straight rib corset--good for rib training</a></p>
<p>The corset above is what you <em>do</em> want for rib training. As you can see, the corset tapers in toward the waist with straight lines, creating more of a \ / shape rather than a ( ) shape at the top of the corset. Conical/straight rib corsets are typically more difficult to find (but don't worry--I'll tell you where you can find them in the "Where Can You Buy an Off-The Rack Corset?" section below). They are also less comfortable than cupped/round rib corsets. The one big advantage of conical/straight rib corsets is that they can be used for rib training.</p>
<p>If you're going to embark on rib training, I'd advise taking it slowly. In my personal experience, corset training before I started rib training was easy peasy, but after I started rib training is when it really started to get difficult. I'll go over when/for how long you should wear your corset more in the "When Should You Wear Your Corset?" section below, but what you need to know as far as rib training is concerned is that you probably won't be able to wear a conical/straight rib corset for as long as you can wear a cupped/round rib corset (at least, not at first).</p>
<p>This is why you need at least two corsets to effectively rib train. Wear your conical/straight rib corset for as long as you can before it starts to become uncomfortable, then switch to your cupped/round rib corset for the remaining hours in your corset training schedule. Don't try to push through the discomfort when rib training, because all you'll do is give yourself bruises. Cartilage takes a long time to move, so consistency is key here. Again, don't push through the discomfort. I've been there/done that and it really doesn't make things move any more quickly.</p>
<h1>How Can You Measure Yourself for a Corset?</h1>
<p>Here's a video explaining how to take the key measurements that you'll need (it's specifically made for Timeless Trends corsets, but it's applicable to corsets from all other brands as well): <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdWSRHOO-C4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdWSRHOO-C4</a></p>
<p>And here's a tool you can use to figure out what the waist size of your corset should be: <a href="https://lucycorsetry.com/research-corset-brands/whats-an-appropriate-waist-reduction-for-me/">https://lucycorsetry.com/research-corset-brands/whats-an-appropriate-waist-reduction-for-me/</a></p>
<p>Basically, you want the underbust measurement of your corset to be as close as possible to your underbust measurement, and you want the hip measurement of your corset to be as close as possible to <strong>but no smaller than</strong> your hip measurement. The waist measurement of your corset can be determined by the tool linked above.</p>
<p>Some corset companies will give you size charts showing the underbust and hip measurements of all their corsets for all the sizes they come in, and these are pretty straightforward. Here's an example:</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/2tpakzsswpjd1.jpg?width=1350&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0662f4ba6e4befa9cc270f6677e73132fec2ee70">https://preview.redd.it/2tpakzsswpjd1.jpg?width=1350&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0662f4ba6e4befa9cc270f6677e73132fec2ee70</a></p>
<p>So, let's say you used the tool I linked and it told you that you should aim for a corseted waist size of around 24 inches. You want to know if the corset in the size chart above would fit you. Based on the size chart, your underbust measurement should be around 35 inches and your hip measurement should be around 36 inches.</p>
<p>Of course, the chances that you'll have the exact perfect measurements for any off-the-rack corset are slim. For this example, your underbust measurement could probably safely be anywhere between 33.5 and 36 inches. For hip measurements, you need to be a bit more strict. In this example, your hip measurement could probably be anywhere between 36 and 38 inches. (There are a couple of different reasons why you have more flexibility with your underbust measurement than with your hip measurement, but I won't bore you with them here. Feel free to ask if you're curious though).</p>
<p>But what if the corset company you're looking at doesn't give you one of these handy dandy size charts? You might see the terms "hip spring" and "rib spring" thrown around, like so:</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/yyss2k7qwpjd1.png?width=632&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c7271cc3165402d453fb9c148d769d447671e031">https://preview.redd.it/yyss2k7qwpjd1.png?width=632&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c7271cc3165402d453fb9c148d769d447671e031</a></p>
<p>These refer to the difference between the underbust/waist and the hip/waist. So, let's say you want to get the corset with the springs listed above in a size 24 (24 inch waist). Since the rib spring is 10, your underbust measurement should be about 10 inches larger than 24 (34 inches). Since the hip spring is 11, your hip measurement should be about 11 inches larger than 24 (35 inches).</p>
<p>Here's another online tool that might be useful: <a href="https://corsetdatabase.com/calculator/">https://corsetdatabase.com/calculator/</a></p>
<h1>Where Can You Buy an Off-the-Rack Corset?</h1>
<p>Figuring out which corset brands are good and which are garbo is honestly very complicated. This reddit comment captures the general consensus pretty well: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/corsets/comments/bka7f0/best_corset_brands/">https://www.reddit.com/r/corsets/comments/bka7f0/best_corset_brands/</a></p>
<p>I personally have purchased off-the-rack corsets from <strong>Timeless Trends</strong> (<a href="https://timeless-trends.com/">https://timeless-trends.com/</a>) as well as from <strong>Mystic City Corsets</strong> (<a href="https://www.mysticcitycorsets.com/">https://www.mysticcitycorsets.com/</a>) and have had excellent experiences with both brands. When reading internet forums about corsets, you'll often see people refer to Timeless Trends as "TT" and Mystic City Corsets as "MCC." These two are considered the gold standard for inexpensive off-the-rack corsets.</p>
<p>I have also purchased an off-the-rack corset from Morgana Femme Couture (<a href="https://www.morganafemmecouture.com/">https://www.morganafemmecouture.com/</a>) and have mixed feelings about it. Her corsets are absolutely beautiful and are indeed very high quality, but the measurements listed in her size charts are sometimes slightly off from the actual measurements of the corsets themselves. This isn't a super big deal, but it is something to keep in mind.</p>
<p>I have also also purchased an off-the-rack corset from Isabella Corsetry (<a href="https://www.corsetmaker.com/">https://www.corsetmaker.com/</a>) and sadly cannot recommend her. Isabella continues to make exceptionally beautiful, comfortable, and high-quality corsets, but unfortunately her customer service is seriously lacking. I waited well over a month to get a corset that should have shipped in less than a week. Other people have waited 6+ months or never gotten their corsets at all. It sucks because her corsets truly are amazing, but she doesn't seem to be able to get orders out in a timely manner (unless something has changed in the past year or so).</p>
<h1>Where Can You Buy a Custom Corset?</h1>
<p>Sometimes you can't find an off-the-rack corset in your measurements or simply want a more comfortable corset. I personally have never purchased a custom corset, but I have heard from others that the comfort level of customs is significantly better than that of off-the-racks.</p>
<p>Since I've never bought a custom myself, I don't have any personal experiences to share. What I can say is that the below corset makers are generally considered to be some of the best:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.valkyriecorsets.com/">https://www.valkyriecorsets.com/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/LovelyRat">https://www.etsy.com/shop/LovelyRat</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.darkgarden.com/">https://www.darkgarden.com/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>There are a lot more excellent custom corset makers than just the 3 listed above. If you're interested, I'd suggest browsing <a href="/r/corsets">r/corsets</a> and seeing what people there are saying.</p>
<h1>How Do You Put on a Corset?</h1>

<h1>How Do You Season a Corset?</h1>
<p>"Seasoning" a corset basically just refers to breaking a corset in (kind of like how you would break in a new pair of shoes). When you get a new corset, you'll need to spend a couple of weeks seasoning it before you can wear it for long periods of time.</p>
<p>A lot of people have a lot of different opinions on the best way to season a corset. I'll share my personal suggestions on how I've found it best to season corsets, but I'll also include some links to corset seasoning guides from other people.</p>
<p><strong>Here's how I do it:</strong></p>
<p>I don't do anything particularly complicated when seasoning my corsets, so this will be fairly short. Basically, I wear my corset for 1-4 hours day for the first week and 3-6 hours a day for the second. After that, it's pretty much good to go for 8+ hour days.</p>
<p>When I'm seasoning my corsets, I lace them snugly but not tightly. I lace a bit tighter the second week than I do the first, but still not super tight.</p>
<p>And that's really all I do. My main thing is just listening to my body and making sure I'm feeling comfortable.</p>

<h1>When Should You Wear Your Corset?</h1>
<p>If you want to get results, you'll need to be prepared to wear your corset for significant periods of time on a consistent basis. By "consistent basis," I mean as close to every day as possible. Some people take weekends off from corset training, and I've done this from time to time, but I do find that it slows my progress down quite a bit.</p>
<p>The minimum amount of time you should aim to wear your corset is 6-8 hours a day (but really closer to 8). On the other extreme, some people will wear their corsets for 23 hours a day (these people are sometimes called "23/7 tightlacers").</p>
<p>In my experience, I found the "ideal" amount of time to wear my corset to be 8-14 hours a day for 5-7 days a week. This is what gave me the quickest and most consistent progress. If I didn't care about making progress and just wanted to maintain what I already had, I could be a lot more lenient with it.</p>
<p>You can wear your corset while you sleep or you can wear it during the day--both will give you equally good results as long as you put enough hours in. I always wore mine during the day, but puppygirl always wore hers at night, and she made just as much progress as I did.</p>
<p><strong>Considerations if you're wearing your corset during the day:</strong></p>
<p>There are two main reasons why you might choose to corset train during the day:</p>
<ol>
<li>You find it uncomfortable to sleep in a corset</li>
<li>You want to take advantage of the shapewear properties of the corset underneath your outfits (more on how to do this in the "How Do You Stealth a Corset?" section below.</li>
</ol>
<p>One big advantage of wearing your corset during the day is that you can tighten and loosen it as the day progresses. I always adjusted mine every few hours to keep it nice and comfortable, as do many other corset trainers I've spoken to.</p>
<p>There are a few considerations to keep in mind if you're going to wear your corset during the day. Corsets do slightly limit mobility, which could be an issue with more active jobs/lifestyles (but on the flipside, corsets force you to have good posture, which can help you not hurt your back if you're active during the day). As a general rule, shorter corsets will limit your mobility less than longer corsets.</p>
<p>Another thing you might have to think about is eating. Wearing a corset puts pressure on your stomach, which can artificially make you feel fuller sooner. I found it best to eat frequent small meals throughout the day when corseting rather than two or three big meals. I still ended up eating roughly the same amount as I would have if I wasn't wearing a corset because I would get hungry more frequently when I ate smaller portions.</p>
<p>Corseting can also impact your digestion. I'll put a spoiler in case anyone is grossed out by bathroom talk. <span class="md-spoiler-text">Some people find that they have to poop shortly after lacing up their corset in the morning. It's almost like the pressure of the corset pushes things down and out. Conversely, some people find that they can't poop when wearing a corset because the compression prevents their intestines from expanding and contracting as much as they otherwise might. </span></p>
<p>Finally, you'll have to consider wearing your corset in public. It is totally possible to hide the fact that you're wearing a corset--even under tight clothing--and I'll explain that in further detail in the "How Do You Stealth a Corset" section.</p>
<p>Wearing your corset under your clothes is how you can get a really dramatic waist reduction. If you want your waist to be 10 inches smaller than it is right now, a corset could probably do that for you (in time--you have to work your way up to it). So if you're super dysphoric about your waist and decide that you want to corset train, I'd suggest wearing it during the day so that you can take full advantage of the results.</p>
<p><strong>Considerations if you're wearing your corset overnight:</strong></p>
<p>There are three main reasons why you might choose to corset train overnight:</p>
<ol>
<li>You don't want to have to worry with stealthing the corset</li>
<li>You don't want to have to deal with limited mobility during the day</li>
<li>You experience eating/digestive issues when wearing your corset</li>
</ol>
<p>Wearing your corset overnight will be difficult if you toss and turn a lot in your sleep. I'm not saying it's impossible, but it might not be very easy.</p>
<p>If you sleep on your back and don't tend to toss and turn, you're the perfect candidate for wearing a corset overnight.</p>
<p>If you sleep on your side, you'll want to use a pillow between your corseted waist and your mattress to help prop it up.</p>
<p>In general, you can't lace your corset as tightly overnight as you might during the day. Our bodies naturally expand a bit while we're sleeping (it's part of how our bodies process waste and whatnot). Also, you don't want to wake up in the middle of the night feeling uncomfortable, so to play it safe I'd lace a bit more loosely. You'll still make plenty of progress over the course of weeks/months as you gradually tighten the corset.</p>
<p>Here's a link to a reddit post where people discuss tips and tricks for sleeping in corsets: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/corsets/comments/ov93tu/who_sleeps_in_a_corset/">https://www.reddit.com/r/corsets/comments/ov93tu/who_sleeps_in_a_corset/</a></p>
<h1>How Do You Stealth a Corset?</h1>
<p>"Stealthing" a corset simply means wearing a corset in a way that doesn't make it obvious that you're wearing a corset. If primarily want to wear your corset under your clothing, you probably want to stealth.</p>
<p>The easiest way to stealth a corset is to get the right type of corset. What we're trying to avoid here is the dreaded "corset penis." Basically, certain types of corsets will stick out at the bottom (especially when you sit down), which creates a bulge.</p>
<p>Corsets that are pointed at the bottom of the busk are the worst for stealthing. Avoid anything shaped like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/o5lc2j1reqjd1.jpg?width=600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d126b2bc155789b3e8b4727990ea24b87adbe999">very bad for stealthing--will give your corset penis</a></p>
<p>That point at the bottom center will stick out and create a visible bulge, which is no good.</p>
<p>Instead, look for something shaped like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/p2wnklx9fqjd1.jpg?width=625&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d1a41865e3eb1ec3aea3a1c65d9fd056611e090">good for stealthing--will not give you corset penis</a></p>
<p>See how the line at the bottom is nice and smooth? This is much less likely to stick out when you sit down.</p>
<p>When buying a corset for the purpose of stealthing, stick to solid colors like white, nude, or black. Avoid anything patterned as it is much more likely to show through under clothing.</p>
<p>You can also buy closed-front corsets like the one below. These are more annoying to put on, but they are a bit easier to stealth.</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/v9bbdv1ufqjd1.jpg?width=427&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6d6972339f840f5a9d640632af895414fad5ff6e">a closed-front (buskless) corset</a></p>
<p>I always recommend wearing shapewear overtop of a corset when stealthing. I think this makes a really big difference in terms of smoothing everything out. Here's a link to the shapewear I use when stealthing (but any kind of shapewear you prefer will work): <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08M8ZCZPG/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08M8ZCZPG/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1</a></p>
<p>Thicker fabrics will always hide a corset better than thinner ones, but that doesn't mean it's impossible to wear thin fabrics when stealthing. You might just need to layer on an extra slip or cami overtop of the corset and shapewear to make sure everything stays smoothed out.</p>
<h1>Bonus: Hip Padding</h1>
<p>While I'm on the topic of shapewear and foundation garments, I want to give an honorable mention to hip padding. If you're wondering how the Victorians got such tiny waists, a lot of it actually comes down to hip padding.</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/pj08opizgqjd1.jpg?width=397&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c9db541ea3d4d987b5a8c2cda0621a8c906b368a">this bitch is wearing fake hips</a></p>
<p>What makes a waist look small has a lot less to do with the actual size of the waist and a lot more to do with the hip to waist ratio. The more extreme your hip to waist ratio, the smaller your waist will look. So if you really want to maximize the tiny waist potential of a corset, I'd highly suggest adding hip padding.</p>
<p>The best way to combine hip padding with a corset is to wear it overtop of the corset itself once the corset is closed. When I stealth my corset, I put on my foundation garments in this order:</p>
<ol>
<li>Bra and panties (duh)</li>
<li>Cami (you don't want your corset to sit against your bare skin)</li>
<li>Corset</li>
<li>Shapewear bodysuit</li>
<li>Hip padding</li>
</ol>
<p>However, you can also wear hip padding underneath your corset if the corset is too big for you on the hips. This doesn't work as well and can look sort of lumpy, but it's another option if you're dead set on getting a super pear-shaped corset.</p>
<p>Here's a link to the hip padding I use (but honestly it's probably all the same, just use whatever you prefer): <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09YLGGSC2/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09YLGGSC2/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1</a></p>
<h1>Bonus: Lucy's Corsetry</h1>
<p>You might have noticed that a lot of the links I included point back to <a href="https://lucycorsetry.com/">https://lucycorsetry.com/</a></p>
<p>This is a great resource for all things corset-related, but I should give you an important caveat that Lucy <em>will not ever</em> say anything explicitly negative about any corset brand. Part of how she makes her money is by "reviewing" corsets that corset makers send her, so she can't risk saying anything bad about them. The info she shares is still great, just be warned that she will review some pretty terrible corsets without actually telling you how terrible they are.</p>

<p>Also, I simply do not have it in me to proofread this novel. Please forgive any typos.</p>

            <div>
                <div class="md"><p>This is my first time ever hearing about rib binding, so I am admittedly not very knowledgeable able about it. I'll go based on what is outlined in the post you shared though. </p>
<p>If you do rib training with a corset, what you're doing is pushing your lower floating ribs inward. They are connected with cartridge, which can become more flexible over time, allowing you to compress the lower ribs further inwards. This also seems to be what the person in the rib binding post is trying to do. </p>
<p>I would say that the main difference between rib training using a corset and rib binding would be in where and how the compressive force is applied. A conical/straight rib corset will disperse the force down into your waist as well as against the lower ribs. Rib binding (at least, what that post discusses) would apply the force only to the lower ribs. I would imagine that rib training with a corset would be more comforable/more sustainable long-term than rib binding because spreading out that compressive force over a larger area will help prevent bruising. What you don't want to do is end up brusing your ribs--because this will just make them hurt without actually making them turn inward any more. </p>
<p>Another potential benefit of rib training using a corset as opposed to rib binding could theoretically be that the upper part of the corset would prevent your upper ribcage from flaring out in response to the pressure applied on the lower floating ribs. </p>
<p>In theory, the main benefit of rib binding rather than rib training using a corset would be that you could directly start compressing the target area sooner. If you use a corset, you'll most likely need to reduce your waist a bit before you're able to start working on your ribs. </p>
<p>As far as how permanent the results are, this is tricky to say. There's some evidence that HRT might make the connective tissue and cartridge on your lower floating ribs more flexible, so this could work in your favor. You'd probably also want to weight cycle to make the results as permanent as possible. </p>
<p>This is purely just conjecture, but in my opinion the best way to get the quickest and most perment possible results with rib training would be this (note that what I'm suggesting below is a very aggressive approach--I'd only recommend it for people who are suffering intensely with rib dysphoria):</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Purchase a conical/straight rib corset with a waist size 2-4 inches smaller than your natural waist, a hip size 2-4 inches larger than your hip measurement, and a rib size 0.5-2 inches larger than your underbust measurement. </p></li>
<li><p>Season the corset over the course of 2-3 weeks (conical/straight rib corsets tend to take longer to season)</p></li>
<li><p>Wear the corset for at least 8 hours a day (the more the better) while actively gaining weight. If possible, try to very very gradually tighten the corset more and more as you gain weight.</p></li>
<li><p>Once you're able to wear the corset fully closed for at least 8 hours a day comfortably, it's time to get a smaller corset and start losing weight (to get rid of any intercostal fat deposits you may have between your ribs)</p></li>
<li><p>Get a smaller corset (I can't suggest measurements for this one without knowing how the weight gain process went for you, but it will be smaller and almost certainly "curvier")</p></li>
<li><p>Repeat the seasoning process.</p></li>
<li><p>Repeat the corset training process as you actively lose weight</p></li>
<li><p>Now you're really skinny (maybe skinner than you want to be) and are able to fully close your smaller corset</p></li>
<li><p>If you're happy with how you look now, stop here. If you're skinnier than you want to be, do steps 1-3 again. </p></li>
<li><p>To maintain your results, put the corset on for a few hours each week. If it's still really easy to put on, you can scale back to just a few hours each month</p></li>
</ol>

                <div class="md"><p>Could u tell me more about the intercostal fat deposits? I’m going to cut 1-3 more kgs before i start gaining, and i’m going to be taking pioglitazone which should minimalise torso fat gain(reduces visceral fat, increases subq fat and should mainly go to gynoid areas) so i wonder if that changes things. And what do you mean with weight cycling making it more permanent? Because i was planning on just only gaining but now i feel like i have a reason to do one cycle which i don’t mind doing</p>

                <div class="md"><p>You're welcome!!! Corset training can actually be great if you do it while you're actively gaining weight because there is some anecdotal evidence that it may help you put fat on your hips/thighs/boobs rather than your waist. If you plan on gaining weight, I'd suggest getting a slightly larger starter corset. So maybe get one with a waist size just 2-4 inches smaller than your current natural waist. Look for one with a hip measurement a good 2-5 larger than what you have now (depending on how much weight you plan on gaining) and a rib measurement 1-3 inches larger than your current underbust. These measurement are rough estimates tho. If you want, feel free to DM me your current measurements and I may be able to help you find something.</p>

                <div class="md"><p>A lot of that is sensationalized stuff. I wouldn't say that corsets are inherently "bad" or "good." They can be damaging if you aren't careful with them, but so can high heels. I wouldn't recommend that anyone start corset training unless it's something you're genuinely interested in or unless you have mega terrible dysphoria about your waist though.</p>

                <div class="md"><p>This is stupid as hell. You should never fight against your body. Just do planks and side planks. Low load, short bursts for like 30 secs, offer but far away from failure. All so you train your muscle nerve connection but not go into hypertrophy. Then your core muscles work as a corset but in a safe way.</p>

                <div class="md"><p>tysm!!  one question: if i wear it while i sleep, is there any danger of becoming lopsided if i end up in a lopsided position for a long time?  would that be a potential reason to prefer wearing it during the day?  i sleep on my stomach and move around a lot while i sleep so slightly worried about this (<em>no</em> idea how i'll sleep when recovering from ffs but i'll cross that bridge when i get to it :s)</p>

                <div class="md"><p>Good question! There would indeed be a small risk of that happening. The risk would probably be less for a stomach-sleeper because you aren't really putting a lot more pressure on one side of your waist than you are on the other. The biggest risk would be if you were a side sleeper and always slept on your left or always slept on your right. You could mitigate the risk somewhat by supporting your waist with a memory foam pillow.</p>
<p>I am also a stomach sleeper and move around a ton in my sleep. I haven't been able to sleep in a corset for more than a few hours at a time because all the tossing and turning shifts it around and makes it uncomfortable. </p>
<p>Puppygirl is a stomach sleeper too, but she can actually sleep quite comfortably in a corset. The main difference between her and I is that she doesn't roll around a lot. She did her corset training exclusively overnight and got great results from it, so it certainly is possible, but it might not be comfortable for you.</p>
