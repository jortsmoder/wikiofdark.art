<h1>Topical fat reduction from the waist</h1>
<html><body><div><div class="abstract-content selected" id="eng-abstract">

<strong class="sub-title">
          Objective:
        </strong>
      
      Topical fat reduction from the thigh in women using aminophylline cream has been demonstrated, but the local fat reduction in other body areas or in men by lowering the local lipolytic threshold has not been demonstrated. This study is designed to test the hypothesis that aminophylline cream application to the waist will reduce waist circumference compared with a control.
    </p>

<strong class="sub-title">
          Research methods and procedures:
        </strong>
      
      Fifty men and women who are 21-65 years of age with a BMI greater than 27 kg/m(2) and a waist to hip ratio &gt; or =average were randomized in a 1 : 1 ratio to 0.5% aminophylline cream to the waist twice a day or no treatment to the waist. All subjects were instructed to follow a 1200 kcal balanced diet, participate in a walking program and return biweekly to encourage compliance. A theophylline level was drawn monthly, and the waist, BMI and waist to hip ratio were remeasured at 12 weeks.
    </p>
<p>
<strong class="sub-title">
          Results:
        </strong>
      
      At week 12, there was a significant reduction in BMI from baseline that was not different between the groups. The reduction in waist circumference was 11 +/- 1.0 cm in the aminophylline cream group and 5.0 +/- 0.6 cm in the control group (p &lt; 0.001). The reduction in waist circumference was significant for both women and men, but the women lost significantly more waist girth. The waist to hip ratio, a measure of fat distribution, declined. Aminophylline levels were undetectable, and there were no adverse events.

          Discussion:
        </strong>
      
      Aminophylline cream offers a safe and effective method for cosmetic local fat reduction from the waist.
