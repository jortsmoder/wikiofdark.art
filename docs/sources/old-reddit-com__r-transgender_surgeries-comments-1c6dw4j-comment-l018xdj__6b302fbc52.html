<h1>What do you see as the characteristic "style" or aesthetic of the main FFS surgeons (DB, Keojampa, Mardirossian, Lee etc.)</h1>

                <div class="md"><p>I’ll give my 2 cents:</p>
<p>DB: Narrow chin/jaw, very full cheeks, dramatic eyes sometimes leaning towards doll-ishness in the upper third, harmonious noses</p>
<p>Keojampa: Kibbe “romantic” faces, full rounded cheeks, often short philtrum with tooth show</p>
<p>Mardirossian: nose is often similar with reduced bridge and graceful slightly upturned tip, rounded hairline with a preference for hairline incision</p>
<p>Harrison Lee: Insta model, glamorous, small forehead, petite nose, full cheeks, often dramatic V line</p>
<p>That being said, having looked at so many results here online and during consults with some of these doctors, I think they are just about all very much trying to cater what they do to the individual and what she wants and it is by no means a one size fits all. With few exceptions, patients who see them end up looking beautifully unique imo</p>

                <div class="md"><p>I guess I mean I never really NOTICE the nose on his patients which is what I mean by harmonious. I guess it is kind of the same, but it blends which is what you want your nose to do</p>

                <div class="md"><p>thats fair. to me they stand out, but im also used to looking at them in this context so i probably have that bias. if i just saw them out in public id probably just think they look nice</p>
<p>i just also found "harmonious" a bit of a funny word since it implies some sort of harmony with your other features (i.e he's doing it with the rest of your face in mind). but its also just the same nose. but youre right that it does do that haha</p>
