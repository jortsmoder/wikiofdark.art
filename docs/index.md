## HRT

there is plenty of info on E and AAs and the like online. Info can be added here, but I am interested in very niche things here.

## Weight Cycling

The process of repetitively gaining and subsequently losing weight.

Typically when on HRT, it takes a long time for fat to redistribute to the desired places. The turnover rate for adipocyte cells at a constant bodyweight is about 10% per year, with half of the adipocytes being replaced every ~8.3 years on average. 

Some have suggested that weight cycling when on HRT can lead to getting results sooner.

 * [Mesityl - MTF Weight Cycling](https://mesityl.substack.com/p/mtf-weight-cycling){ .source-link }
    * A good introduction on the topic, covers many of the things below, has more sources cited, and also discusses some things to avoid.

### Downcycle

In the down cycle, the aim is to have a caloric deficit, and hopefully pull more fat from "undesired places" rather than from relatively desireable places.

### Maintining a caloric deficit

Depending on the person, it may be difficult to keep a caloric deficit. There are some things that can help with this:

### Caloric Deficit through Diets

- different diets seem to work for different people. todo: add more detail

### Caloric Defficit with assistance of supplements

#### Water-soluble fibres
such as Psyllium Husk or Glucomannan are effective at filling up the stomach/digestive tract and promoting a feeling of fullness, reducing appetite and promoting weight loss. 

#### GLP-1 Agonists
There are various GLP-1 receptor agonists drugs like semaglutide, liraglutide, dulaglutide, exenatide, and tirzepatide. These promote weight loss through increasing insulin release, decreasing insulin resistance and decreasing excessive glucagon release. Their biggest downsides include very high price and the only viable RoA being injection.

### Down cyle - Burning the right fat

#### Aminophylline


Aminophylline is a compound of the bronchodilator theophylline with ethylenediamine in a 2:1 ratio. It is a little-studied drug that inhibits dual phosphodiesterase (PDE) which causes cAMP to surge, and thus increase lipolysis.

* [Link to Meta-analysis](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9978326/){ .source-link }

In particular, [one study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17391155/){.source-link} on 25 men/women, when on a 1200kcal diet, achieved a reduction in waist circumference of 11 ± 1.0 cm when using 0.5% aminophylline, compared to a reduction of 5.0 ± 0.6 cm in the control group.

However, there is not that much discussion of this online. Here is all I could find:

??? note "Sourcing, according to ChatGPT"

    You can order **raw aminophylline powder** from laboratory-chemical vendors, while medical distributors will only supply it under a prescription or professional license.  

    Research / lab‐grade suppliers (no prescription, “for research use only”):  

    - **Thermo Fisher Scientific** – Aminophylline, anhydrous, 98%, 25 g bottle, catalog J60705; price ≈ US $40.70. [link](https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/J60705.14)

    Regulatory note: Aminophylline is an FDA-listed prescription drug, so supplies intended for human or animal treatment normally require a prescriber’s order or a pharmacy/DEA license; research-grade material from chemical suppliers is labeled *not for human or veterinary use* and should be handled in accordance with local hazardous-chemical regulations. [link](https://www.boundtree.com/pharmaceuticals/rx-pharmaceuticals/aminophylline-25mg-ml-20ml-vial/p/5922-01)

#### Glycyrrhetinic acid

Much less discussed than aminophylline. 

There is like one study from 2005 which seems to suggest a small reduction in a month without negligible weight loss, and it seems like nobody has tried to replicate it:

- [Paper on 9 treatment + 9 control patients](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15894038/){.source-link}

> Weight (kg), before -> after
> 
> * treated: 60.5 ± 0.6 -> 60.2 ± 0.6 kg
> * placebo: 59.2 ± 0.4 -> 59.0 ± 0.4 kg
>
> Circumference at middle of thigh (cm), before --> after:
>
> * treated thigh: 52.7 ± 1.0 --> 52.4 ± 1.0
> * untreated thigh: 52.9 ± 1.4 --> 52.8 ± 1.4 
> * placebo thigh: 51.9 ± 1.0 --> 51.8 ± 1.0
> * untreated thigh: 51.1 ± 0.9 --> 51.2 ± 0.9
> 
> TLDR: 0.3cm difference after 1 month of applying 80mg 2.5% GA daily. minimal change in weight (~0.3kg)

Other studies seem mostly to be in vitro, eg:
- [in vitro lipolysis study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0006291X12005384){.source-link}

There is even less discussion of GA online/on reddit:
- [Reddit post from u/Lopsided_Bar2863 on r/4tran4 on aminophylline and glycyrrhetinic acid](https://old.reddit.com/r/4tran4/comments/1eq12mv/poons_theres_a_lifesaver_to_reduce_your_ass/){.source-link}

#### Topical Caffeine

Caffeine appears to affect the same PDE pathway as aminophylline, but there are not many studies using just caffeine.

Some examples:

* [study on 7% caffeine for cellulite](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17524126/){.source-link}
> "They were told to apply it in just one leg (thigh and hip) in order to keep the other one as control. The solution was applied twice daily (morning and night), and the dose was ∼15 mL per leg (thigh)."
>
> "99 completed the protocol"
> 
> "A 30-day treatment with this caffeine solution showed statistical significance concerning the reduction of circumference in treated thighs. This reduction was observed in more than 80% of the patients and was of about 2.1 cm in the thicker portion of the thigh and 1.7 cm in the lower portion. The use of 7% caffeine solution was also statistically significant in the reduction of hip circumference in 67.7% of the treated patients."

* [study on 3.5% caffeine for cellulite](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26082579/){.source-link}
> Thigh and upper-arm circumferences decreased by 0.7 cm (1.7%) and 0.8 cm (2.3%), respectively, at week 6. (No control was provided).


* [Study on caffeine + retinol + carnitine + others](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3933246/){.source-link}
> Maintain usual diet + twice daily (caffeine + retinol + carnitine + others).
> 12 weeks treatment:
> 
> Abdomen: −1.1cm (vs −0.4cm)
> Thighs: -0.8cm (vs −0.3cm)
> Hips: −0.8cm (vs −0.4cm)

Transdermal caffein


#### Waist-training
As another option, if looking particularly to improve WHR or get a more hour-glass figure, could be waist training. This can often reduce appetite while worn. This usually is done by causing the floating ribs 8-12 to shift inwards, and may cause some organs to move around. People who do it consider it safe but DYOR.

#### Rib reshaping surgery

Breaking the ribs and reshaping using a corset. Usually only targets lower floaring ribs (10-12). Basically same effect as corset but longer-lasting / doesn't need continuous maintenence.

See [Reddit wiki](https://old.reddit.com/r/TransSurgeriesWiki/wiki/other#wiki_rib_reshaping) for more info.

* Reddit: [Waist narrowing surgery by AnyaAnn in 2020](https://old.reddit.com/r/MtF/comments/g36qn0/waist_narrowing_surgery/){.source-link}

* Article: [Rib Reshaping Better Than Rib Removal For Waistline Narrowing?](https://www.eppleyplasticsurgery.com/is-rib-reshaping-better-than-rib-removal-for-waistline-narrowing/){.source-link}



#### Dangerous Darth Method
This is a subtype of "waist training".

This method, labelled dangerous, by darth, involves following practices that are actively reccomended against in the FtM community when binding. may cause pain, costochondritis, cracked or fractured ribs, reduced lung capacity, lung or kidney damage from floating ribs etc.

[Darth Method Writeup](https://old.reddit.com/r/estrogel/comments/iod975/unrelated_darth_dangerous_experiments_diy_shrink/){ .source-link }

> starting: 32" underbust
> after a "few weeks": 29.5" immediately when removed, 30.5 after an hour
> 3 weeks later: 29 inches underbust with the binder, 30.0 without
> after 2 years on, 1 year off: 29.5" stable

#### Selective Muscle training
Strength training of specific muscles (e.g. the abdominals) prior to endurance training (e.g. a long cardio session) might be able to selectively burn fat in the corresponding area – this could be useful when trying to achieve a lower WHR.


#### Acetyl-l-carnitine (ALCAR)

is an orally bioavailable form of carnitine which is involved in the carnitine shuttle and is vital to fat metabolism. Supplementation has been shown to improve rates of fat metabolism and weight loss.

#### Other things NOT worth considering:


### The Upcycle - Growing the right fat

Gaining weight, with the hope that it grows in the "right places"

#### Weight gain supplements

Just like with downcycling, there are a range of supplements that could be used to aid your upcycle…


#### Pioglitazone
"pio" is an anti-diabetic medication that activates PPAR-gamma systemically, reducing insulin resistance, gluconeogenesis and overall blood sugar. High insulin resistance in transgender females is associated with android fat distribution/higher WHR. It has been shown to lower visceral fat and WHR even in patients who’s overall BMI remained the same.

It seems to protect subcutaneous fat in a way similar to estrogen. There has even been one documented case of pioglitazone use to achieve female fat distribution in a transgender patient in the medical literature. The drug would probably be beneficial regardless of whether you are cycling or not.

Out of everything I have mentioned this is in my opinion probably the single most effective tool for achieving female fat distribution.

It has been associated with some risks to kidneys, but for short-term use it should generally be fine.

Typically people take it orally, but there are some reports of taking it topically:
* [Topical Pio + AH38](https://old.reddit.com/r/DIYCosmeticProcedures/comments/1g4v3wp/topical_pioglitazone_ah38_for_lost_volume/){.source-link}

#### Acetyl-Hexapeptide-38 (Adifyline®)
Adifyline®, topically applied increases PGC-1α expression, stimulating adipogenesis and lipid accumulation as a consequence67 (in a way opposite to hexapeptide-39). Again, the local effect of the drug could be leveraged to selectively increase fat in certain areas and thus improve WHR/fat distribution.

In general, reports are pretty hit-or-miss, unclear if due to application method differences or genetic differences or both. There is like, one study on it:

 * [Adifyline Peptide Brochure](https://daltosur.com/media/documents/adifyline-peptidebrochure.pdf)

Stories from people:

 * [Reddit post on Adyfiline with information on dosing](https://old.reddit.com/r/DIYaesthetics/comments/1gt4n3m/adifyline_purchasingvolume_guide/){.source-link}, as well as [Follow up comments from the author](https://ihsoyct.github.io/index.html?backend=artic_shift&mode=comments&author=Gloomy-Scarcity-2197&limit=100&sort=desc&body=adifyline){.source-link}, seems to think it works.
 * [Other reddit post](https://old.reddit.com/r/DIYCosmeticProcedures/comments/1b46il3/adifyline_experimentation/){.source-link}, no method reported, didn't seem to work for them. 
 * [Other reddit post](https://old.reddit.com/r/DIYCosmeticProcedures/comments/18onbl8/adifyline_update_explanation/){.source-link}, strong positive results, reports increasing from A/B-cup to C-cup. "I made the mistake of putting it on my butt and I feel like an hourglass and I don’t like it perhaps because I wasn’t ready for such a transition"
 * 

Typical place to buy is on LotionCrafters:

* [lotioncrafters](https://lotioncrafter.com/collections/active-ingredients/products/adifyline)

#### Acetyl-Hexapeptide-39 (Silusyne®)

topically applied decreases PGC-1α expression, diminishing adipogenesis and lipid accumulation as a consequence. It could potentially be used topically to selectively reduce fat accumulation in certain areas and thus improve WHR/fat distribution.

However, there is, in general, very little literature on this. 

The [Mesityl - MTF Weight Cycling](https://mesityl.substack.com/p/mtf-weight-cycling){ .source-link } post has some discussion on this, and implies that it would work for the down cycle, though it could also make sense for the up cycle to inhibit growth in certain areas.


#### Volufiline

Volufiline is a patented cosmetic preparation containing Sarsapogenin which has been reported to stimulate adipocytic differentiation and adipogenesis by activation of PPAR-gamma. Similarly to the hexapeptide-38, it can be applied topically and perhaps even used synergistically.

* [Volufiline Brochure / Patent filing](/assets/volufiline.pdf)

Some recommend buying sarsapogenin directly:
 * [Reddit post on buying sarasapogenin](https://old.reddit.com/r/estrogel/comments/1bodb0k/dont_waste_money_on_volufiline_get_the_raw/){.source-link}

#### Leucine and Argenine 
Leucine and Argenine have been shown to be particularly effective at activating mTOR, a kinase that stimulates lipid synthesis and cell growth. 


### Other chemicals

#### CJC-1295

CJC-1295 DAC, also known as DAC:GRF, is a synthetic peptide analogue of growth hormone-releasing hormone and a growth hormone secretagogue. It is a modified form of GHRH with improved pharmacokinetics, especially in regard to half-life.

- [article about it](https://allaboutpeptides.com/cjc-1295-peptide/){.source-link}
- [post about it on Reddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/DrWillPowers/comments/uh22mo/cjc1295_wdac_effect_on_breast_growth_and_surgery/){.source-link}

#### ipamorelin

Ipamorelin is a peptide selective agonist of the ghrelin/growth hormone secretagogue receptor and a growth hormone secretagogue. It is a pentapeptide with the amino acid sequence Aib-His-D-2-Nal-D-Phe-Lys-NH₂ that was derived from GHRP-1. Ipamorelin significantly increases plasma growth hormone levels in both animals and humans. In addition, ipamorelin stimulates body weight gain in animals

#### tesmorelin

Tesamorelin is a synthetic hormone used to reduce excess abdominal fat in adults with HIV-associated lipodystrophy. It is administered via subcutaneous injection and requires a prescription from a doctor.

I have seen one report of someone injecting 6/3/3mg mix of tesmorelin/cjc1295/ipamorelin vial into belly fat.

> The cjc1295, I inject into belly fat, a 6/3/3mg mix of tesmorelin/cjc1295/ipamorelin vial. A few minutes after the injection, I can feel a headrush, and any soreness recovery from exercise appears to happen within hours, however there may be soreness in the breasts from tissues expanding.

#### igf-1 DES

Des(1-3)IGF-1 is a truncated form of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) that has enhanced potency compared to IGF-1 due to its reduced binding to insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins. It is used in research and has potential therapeutic applications, particularly in growth-related conditions

> I inject the igf-1 DES in the right breast area as the lymphatic system drains into the left side if I understand it correctly. The DES modification of igf-1 is very potent and activates all the growth receptors, including insulin receptors. The half life isn't very long, but the effect is noticable. About 0.05mL at a time, twice a day, from a 2mL of bacteriostatic water in a 1mg igf-1 DES vial.


#### kisspeptin 

Kisspeptin stimulates production of GnRH, FSH and LH and is much cheaper than (prescription-only) injectable FSH (follitropin). Can lead to additional breast growth.

FSH seems to help with breast growth.

LH stimulates production of testosterone by testicles, so this would need to be controlled, eg, with bicalutamide.


Example dosage:
> 5mg/3ml 0.05 ml thrice a week (injections with insulin syringes with needles 8 mm into fat on thigh, buttock or arm, not abdomen)
> * https://www.uk-peptides.com/kisspeptin-10-peptide
> * https://www.uk-peptides.com/10ml-bacteriostatic-water
>
> reported side effect of kisspeptin:
> - pain in abdomen (influence on intestine or colon).

### Things to Avoid

#### Alcohol Consumption

Moderate alcohol consumption increases abdominal fat, worsening fat distribution, and increases plasma androgens in cisgender females. Therefore it is highly discouraged.


## Face

#### Suncream

Most obvious, shuldn't even need to say it, but do apply suncream to face every day.

#### Retinoids

Retinol (weak) and Tretinoin (strong)

#### Red light therapy

Some early results says it helps.

#### Other things

Hylauranic acids, Niacinamide, Vitamin C, Glycolic Acids, etc... probably help and combine to have a good effect, but not as huge an effect.

#### Face Plumpness

HRT helps. Otherwise, look at Adyfiline, Volufiline, and such. See above.


## Hair

### General care

See reddit tbh I ain't bothered to write it all here.

* [Reddit r/HaircareScience Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/wiki/index/)

#### Fringe

A common strategy in the MtF trans community to "improve shaping of the face" is to get a fringe. 


### Prevent loss / regain growth

#### Finasteride / Dutasteride

Decreases DHT levels to prevent hair loss (NOT an anti-androgen) and is associated with mental health effects. See other websites for this, these are common.

#### Minoxidil

Promotes hair growth. See other website for this, also quite common. (or someone else please update this)

#### Topical Estrogen (without feminization)
> try to wash your face 5 minutes after applying [5 mg/ml estriol serum]: this will only allow the shunt pathway (ie through hair follicules) maximizing the effect on follicules and therefore the pores, without allowing normal transdermal absorption
> this method is used by men using E2 to regrow hair without systemic side effects (like boobs) and is supported by papers I read (search the sub for the shunt pathway)

I haven't looked much at this. See [comment in this unrelated reddit post](https://old.reddit.com/r/estrogel/comments/1bodb0k/dont_waste_money_on_volufiline_get_the_raw/){.source-link}

#### Stop and Go method

Some people have considered stopping estrogen temporarily, then restarting is, as a method to try to "reduce estrogen sensitivity".

This person tried it and it seemed to work for them:

#### Progesterone

??? note "Notes on Progesterone"

    > 1. Injectable progesterone is short-acting, must be injected daily.
    > Oral progesterone is ineffective because most of it is converted to allopregnanolone which common blood tests confuse with progesterone.
    > Neovagina absorbs meds not as well as a cis-woman's vagina.
    > Most progestins give various side effects.
    > Hydroxyprogesterone caproate is not bioidentical.
    > It's not converted in the body to progesterone (unlike estradiol valerate and estradiol enanthate).
    > 
    > 2. Progesterone decreases rate of synthesis of estrogen receptors.
    > Cis-women are supposed to benefit from that, but goals of MtF are opposite.
    >
    > 3. Estradiol develops ducts in milk glands, progesterone develops alveoles.
    > Most of breast volume is ducts and connective tissue between them.
    > If an alveole formed (at the end of a duct), that duct will not grow in length anymore. > So, progesterone and Androcur can stunt breast growth.
    >
    > 4. Progestogens increase risk of prolactinoma and meningioma (brain tumors).
    > Progestogens (especially cyproterone acetate), not estrogens (despite mistaken rumor among medical professionals).
    >
    > I advise NOT to add progesterone for at least 3 years since starting estradiol injections at least 40 mg/month (not since the very beginning of HRT).
    >
    > Or never take progestogens. In cases of complete androgen insensitivity (CAIS),
    > XY women develop rather spectacularly feminine secondary sexual characteristics though nothing in their bodies makes progesterone.

## Preserving Fertility pre-HRT

### Sperm Cryopreservation

#### Ensuring quality

- Avoid heat at all costs. No to Sauna/Hottub. 
- Better to do in winter or spring, to avoid heat.
- Take zinc supplements
- Take omega 3 supplements
- Generally, require 2-4 days of abstinance before storage sessions.
- You usually need to be tested for STIs. 

#### Basics of Storage

Depending on where you are from, it can be annoying to freeze and store gametes. Typically this is done by finding an IVF clinic that allows storing of sperm. It is possible to move sperm between clinics, but generally it is probably better to choose somewhere with good success rates. Transfer between countries can be difficult. You will generally need to pay an annual storage fee on the order of €200-400/year depending on the place.

The success rates are usually measured as pregnancies in <35yo women, <40yo women, and >40yo women. In a decent place, rated for <35to women are usually around a ~50% chance. Each place likes to measure and report different things though. Also note that most people who do IVF do so because they have fertlity issues, so most likely your rate of success will be higher. If a clinic has "donor success rates" that is usually more representitive. These success rates can be improved with genetic screening methods like PGT-A, and some nombers include it and some don't, but is getting more common (though also usually costs extra).

Main methods are In-Vitro Fertilization (IVF) (incl ICSI), where one does fertilisation in vitro, and In-Utero Insemination (IUI), more affordable but less reliable.

Depending on your sperm quality, you will probably need to have multiple storage sessions. You can store anywhere between 1 and ~5 straws in a single session, each typically good for 1 round of IFV, but may need multiple straws for an IUI session. (IUI is typically far less expensive). Typical is 2-3 sessions, but more can also happen.


### Where to Store

In places like UK and Ireland, the process is kinda slow. As of 2025, most places in ireland no longer offer male gamete cryopreservation without a doctor's note due to storage shortage. UK is hit-or-miss with clinics, and in my experience you will be waiting months to do it.

There are some good IVF clinics in Spain which are worth considering, such as IVI or Instituto Bernabeu, which are much faster, with the drawback of needing to spend a week or two in Spain.

### Hyaluronic-acid cheek fillers

* **Skin / fat:** Instantly add mid-face volume, mimicking feminine fat pads; MRI shows persistence 2–15 yrs.
* **Hair:** None.
* **Fertility:** None. ([PubMed][10], [PMC][11])

---

### Autologous facial fat grafting

* **Skin / fat:** Permanent or long-lasting cheek & jaw softening with your own tissue.
* **Hair:** None.
* **Fertility:** None. ([PMC][12])

---

### Systemic estradiol patch / tablet (25–100 µg day⁻¹)

* **Skin / fat:** Only proven non-surgical route to true gluteo-femoral (“hour-glass”) fat shift.
* **Hair:** Lowers scalp androgen load, supporting growth.
* **Fertility:** Predictable LH/FSH suppression and spermatogenesis risk—bank sperm or use hCG co-therapy if chosen. ([PMC][13])

**Key take-away:**
Topical soft-estrogens, peptide serums and modern anti-androgen lotions can soften skin and guard hair with minimal testosterone loss—but **distinctly feminine body-fat curves still require either systemic estradiol or physical volume (fillers / fat grafts), both of which spare male fertility far better than full-dose systemic estrogen.**
