## HRT

there is plenty of info on E and AAs and the like online. Info can be added here, but I am interested in very niche things here.

## Weight Cycling

The process of repetitively gaining and subsequently losing weight.

Typically when on HRT, it takes a long time for fat to redistribute to the desired places. The turnover rate for adipocyte cells at a constant bodyweight is about 10% per year, with half of the adipocytes being replaced every ~8.3 years on average. 

Some have suggested that weight cycling when on HRT can lead to getting results sooner.

    * A good introduction on the topic, covers many of the things below, has more sources cited, and also discusses some things to avoid.

### Downcycle

In the down cycle, the aim is to have a caloric deficit, and hopefully pull more fat from "undesired places" rather than from relatively desireable places.

### Maintining a caloric deficit

Depending on the person, it may be difficult to keep a caloric deficit. There are some things that can help with this:

### Caloric Deficit through Diets

- different diets seem to work for different people. todo: add more detail

### Caloric Defficit with assistance of supplements

#### Water-soluble fibres
such as Psyllium Husk or Glucomannan are effective at filling up the stomach/digestive tract and promoting a feeling of fullness, reducing appetite and promoting weight loss. 

#### GLP-1 Agonists
There are various GLP-1 receptor agonists drugs like semaglutide, liraglutide, dulaglutide, exenatide, and tirzepatide. These promote weight loss through increasing insulin release, decreasing insulin resistance and decreasing excessive glucagon release. Their biggest downsides include very high price and the only viable RoA being injection.

### Down cyle - Burning the right fat

#### Aminophylline

[Link to Meta-analysis](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9978326/){ .source-link }

It is a little-studied drug that inhibits dual phosphodiesterase (PDE) which causes cAMP to surge.

In particular, one study on 25 men/women, when on a 1200kcal diet, achieved a reduction in waist circumference of 11 ± 1.0 cm when using 0.5% aminophylline, compared to a reduction of 5.0 ± 0.6 cm in the control group.

However, there is almost no discussion of this online. 

#### Transdermal Caffeine

Transdermal caffein


#### Waist-training
As another option, if looking particularly to improve WHR or get a more hour-glass figure, could be waist training. This can often reduce appetite while worn. If done correctly this is usually quite safe, thought this does often cause the floating ribs 8-12 to shift inwards, and may cause some organs to move around.

#### Dangerous Darth Method
This is a subtype of "waist training".

This method, labelled dangerous, by darth, involves following practices that are actively reccomended against in the FtM community when binding. may cause pain, costochondritis, cracked or fractured ribs, reduced lung capacity, lung or kidney damage from floating ribs etc.

[Darth Method Writeup](https://old.reddit.com/r/estrogel/comments/iod975/unrelated_darth_dangerous_experiments_diy_shrink/){ .source-link }

#### Selective Muscle training
Strength training of specific muscles (e.g. the abdominals) prior to endurance training (e.g. a long cardio session) might be able to selectively burn fat in the corresponding area – this could be useful when trying to achieve a lower WHR.


#### Acetyl-l-carnitine (ALCAR)

is an orally bioavailable form of carnitine which is involved in the carnitine shuttle and is vital to fat metabolism. Supplementation has been shown to improve rates of fat metabolism and weight loss.

#### Other things NOT worth considering:


### The Upcycle - Growing the right fat

Gaining weight, with the hope that it grows in the "right places"

#### Weight gain supplements

Just like with downcycling, there are a range of supplements that could be used to aid your upcycle…


#### Pioglitazone
"pio" is an anti-diabetic medication that activates PPAR-gamma systemically, reducing insulin resistance, gluconeogenesis and overall blood sugar. High insulin resistance in transgender females is associated with android fat distribution/higher WHR. It has been shown to lower visceral fat and WHR even in patients who’s overall BMI remained the same.

It seems to protect subcutaneous fat in a way similar to estrogen. There has even been one documented case of pioglitazone use to achieve female fat distribution in a transgender patient in the medical literature. The drug would probably be beneficial regardless of whether you are cycling or not.

Out of everything I have mentioned this is in my opinion probably the single most effective tool for achieving female fat distribution.

It has been associated with some risks to kidneys, but for short-term use it should generally be fine.

Typically people take it orally, but there are some reports of taking it topically:
* [Topical Pio + AH38](https://old.reddit.com/r/DIYCosmeticProcedures/comments/1g4v3wp/topical_pioglitazone_ah38_for_lost_volume/){.source-link}

#### Acetyl-Hexapeptide-38 (Adifyline®)
Adifyline®, topically applied increases PGC-1α expression, stimulating adipogenesis and lipid accumulation as a consequence67 (in a way opposite to hexapeptide-39). Again, the local effect of the drug could be leveraged to selectively increase fat in certain areas and thus improve WHR/fat distribution.

In general, reports are pretty hit-or-miss, unclear if due to application method differences or genetic differences or both. There is like, one study on it:

 * [Adifyline Peptide Brochure](https://daltosur.com/media/documents/adifyline-peptidebrochure.pdf)

Stories from people:

 * [Reddit post on Adyfiline with information on dosing](https://old.reddit.com/r/DIYaesthetics/comments/1gt4n3m/adifyline_purchasingvolume_guide/){.source-link}, as well as [Follow up comments from the author](https://ihsoyct.github.io/index.html?backend=artic_shift&mode=comments&author=Gloomy-Scarcity-2197&limit=100&sort=desc&body=adifyline){.source-link}, seems to think it works.
 * [Other reddit post](https://old.reddit.com/r/DIYCosmeticProcedures/comments/1b46il3/adifyline_experimentation/){.source-link}, no method reported, didn't seem to work for them. 
 * [Other reddit post](https://old.reddit.com/r/DIYCosmeticProcedures/comments/18onbl8/adifyline_update_explanation/){.source-link}, strong positive results, reports increasing from A/B-cup to C-cup. "I made the mistake of putting it on my butt and I feel like an hourglass and I don’t like it perhaps because I wasn’t ready for such a transition"

Typical place to buy is on LotionCrafters:

#### Acetyl-Hexapeptide-39 (Silusyne®)

topically applied decreases PGC-1α expression, diminishing adipogenesis and lipid accumulation as a consequence. It could potentially be used topically to selectively reduce fat accumulation in certain areas and thus improve WHR/fat distribution.

However, there is, in general, very little literature on this. 

The [Mesityl - MTF Weight Cycling](https://mesityl.substack.com/p/mtf-weight-cycling){ .source-link } post has some discussion on this, and implies that it would work for the down cycle, though it could also make sense for the up cycle to inhibit growth in certain areas.


#### Volufiline

Volufiline is a patented cosmetic preparation containing Sarsapogenin which has been reported to stimulate adipocytic differentiation and adipogenesis by activation of PPAR-gamma. Similarly to the hexapeptide-38, it can be applied topically and perhaps even used synergistically.

* [Volufiline Brochure / Patent filing](/assets/volufiline.pdf)

Some recommend buying sarsapogenin directly:
 * [Reddit post on buying sarasapogenin](https://old.reddit.com/r/estrogel/comments/1bodb0k/dont_waste_money_on_volufiline_get_the_raw/){.source-link}

#### Leucine and Argenine 
Leucine and Argenine have been shown to be particularly effective at activating mTOR, a kinase that stimulates lipid synthesis and cell growth. 


### Other chemicals

#### CJC-1295

CJC-1295 DAC, also known as DAC:GRF, is a synthetic peptide analogue of growth hormone-releasing hormone and a growth hormone secretagogue. It is a modified form of GHRH with improved pharmacokinetics, especially in regard to half-life.

- [article about it](https://allaboutpeptides.com/cjc-1295-peptide/){.source-link}
- [post about it on Reddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/DrWillPowers/comments/uh22mo/cjc1295_wdac_effect_on_breast_growth_and_surgery/){.source-link}

#### ipamorelin

Ipamorelin is a peptide selective agonist of the ghrelin/growth hormone secretagogue receptor and a growth hormone secretagogue. It is a pentapeptide with the amino acid sequence Aib-His-D-2-Nal-D-Phe-Lys-NH₂ that was derived from GHRP-1. Ipamorelin significantly increases plasma growth hormone levels in both animals and humans. In addition, ipamorelin stimulates body weight gain in animals

#### tesmorelin

Tesamorelin is a synthetic hormone used to reduce excess abdominal fat in adults with HIV-associated lipodystrophy. It is administered via subcutaneous injection and requires a prescription from a doctor.

I have seen one report of someone injecting 6/3/3mg mix of tesmorelin/cjc1295/ipamorelin vial into belly fat.

> The cjc1295, I inject into belly fat, a 6/3/3mg mix of tesmorelin/cjc1295/ipamorelin vial. A few minutes after the injection, I can feel a headrush, and any soreness recovery from exercise appears to happen within hours, however there may be soreness in the breasts from tissues expanding.

#### igf-1 DES

Des(1-3)IGF-1 is a truncated form of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) that has enhanced potency compared to IGF-1 due to its reduced binding to insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins. It is used in research and has potential therapeutic applications, particularly in growth-related conditions

> I inject the igf-1 DES in the right breast area as the lymphatic system drains into the left side if I understand it correctly. The DES modification of igf-1 is very potent and activates all the growth receptors, including insulin receptors. The half life isn't very long, but the effect is noticable. About 0.05mL at a time, twice a day, from a 2mL of bacteriostatic water in a 1mg igf-1 DES vial.


#### kisspeptin 

Kisspeptin stimulates production of GnRH, FSH and LH and is much cheaper than (prescription-only) injectable FSH (follitropin). Can lead to additional breast growth.

FSH seems to help with breast growth.

LH stimulates production of testosterone by testicles, so this would need to be controlled, eg, with bicalutamide.


Example dosage:
> 5mg/3ml 0.05 ml thrice a week (injections with insulin syringes with needles 8 mm into fat on thigh, buttock or arm, not abdomen)
> * https://www.uk-peptides.com/kisspeptin-10-peptide
> * https://www.uk-peptides.com/10ml-bacteriostatic-water
>
> reported side effect of kisspeptin:
> - pain in abdomen (influence on intestine or colon).

### Things to Avoid

#### Alcohol Consumption

Moderate alcohol consumption increases abdominal fat, worsening fat distribution, and increases plasma androgens in cisgender females. Therefore it is highly discouraged.


## Face

#### Suncream

Most obvious, shuldn't even need to say it, but do apply suncream to face every day.

#### Retinoids

Retinol (weak) and Tretinoin (strong)

#### Red light therapy

Some early results says it helps.

#### Other things

Hylauranic acids, Niacinamide, Vitamin C, Glycolic Acids, etc... probably help and combine to have a good effect, but not as huge an effect.

#### Volume

apart from HRT, look at Adyfiline, Volufiline, and such. See above.


## Hair

### General care

#### Fringe

A common strategy in the MtF trans community to "improve shaping of the face" is to get a fringe. 

#### Better hair care and styling

Looking after your hair in the right way can make it look a lot better. I am a non-expert on this, but things that help me:

(note: I have moderately long thin fine wavy hair, type 2B). 

Mistakes I have made:
- Using conditioner that is too heavy for my fine hair
- When drying my hair after a shower, brushing it and letting it dry flat. I find this makes the hair flat when it's dried. A good way to prevent flatness is by shaking your hair to dry if after brushing it.

Other people will have different tips, so please add if you have some.

### Prevent loss / regain growth

#### Finasteride / Dutasteride

Decreases DHT levels to prevent hair loss (NOT an anti-androgen) and is associated with mental health effects. See other websites for this, these are common.

#### Minoxidil

Promotes hair growth. See other website for this, also quite common. (or someone else please update this)

#### Estrogen (without feminization)
> try to wash your face 5 minutes after applying [5 mg/ml estriol serum]: this will only allow the shunt pathway (ie through hair follicules) maximizing the effect on follicules and therefore the pores, without allowing normal transdermal absorption
> this method is used by men using E2 to regrow hair without systemic side effects (like boobs) and is supported by papers I read (search the sub for the shunt pathway)

I haven't looked much at this. See [comment in this unrelated reddit post](https://old.reddit.com/r/estrogel/comments/1bodb0k/dont_waste_money_on_volufiline_get_the_raw/){.source-link}

#### Hair Transplant

Todo: add more info here.

## Breast Growth

#### Adifyline and Volufiline

See sections above

#### Stop and Go method

Some people have considered stopping estrogen temporarily, then restarting is, as a method to try to "reduce estrogen sensitivity".

This person tried it and it seemed to work for them:

* [Follow up post claiming it now endorsed by Dr. Powers](https://old.reddit.com/r/estrogel/comments/jjvwqr/looks_like_the_stopandgo_is_also_endorsed_read/){.source-link}


#### Progesterone

> 1. Injectable progesterone is short-acting, must be injected daily.
> Oral progesterone is ineffective because most of it is converted to allopregnanolone which common blood tests confuse with progesterone.
> Neovagina absorbs meds not as well as a cis-woman's vagina.
> Most progestins give various side effects.
> Hydroxyprogesterone caproate is not bioidentical.
> It's not converted in the body to progesterone (unlike estradiol valerate and estradiol enanthate).
> 
> 2. Progesterone decreases rate of synthesis of estrogen receptors.
> Cis-women are supposed to benefit from that, but goals of MtF are opposite.
>
> 3. Estradiol develops ducts in milk glands, progesterone develops alveoles.
> Most of breast volume is ducts and connective tissue between them.
> If an alveole formed (at the end of a duct), that duct will not grow in length anymore. > So, progesterone and Androcur can stunt breast growth.
>
> 4. Progestogens increase risk of prolactinoma and meningioma (brain tumors).
> Progestogens (especially cyproterone acetate), not estrogens (despite mistaken rumor among medical professionals).
>
> I advise NOT to add progesterone for at least 3 years since starting estradiol injections at least 40 mg/month (not since the very beginning of HRT).
>
> Or never take progestogens. In cases of complete androgen insensitivity (CAIS),
> XY women develop rather spectacularly feminine secondary sexual characteristics though nothing in their bodies makes progesterone.
