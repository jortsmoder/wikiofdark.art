## What is this?

This is a dump of some things I have on looksmaxxing your transition. Some things are far more researched than others. Some things are way more important, and some things have marginal benefits at best. Some things are much safer than others. Everything is currently a work in progress.

## How should I start?

In general, if you are new, the order I would reccomend is approximately:

1. Start trying to do gamete storage
2. Start permanent hair removal
3. Once gamete storage done, start HRT
4. Do voice training
5. Worry about other things (or possibly not)

The only important part is that you do gamete storage before starting HRT (though it is possible to do so shortly after starting also). These topics have the most discussion online, and likely this wiki will not have all the information you need about 1 - 4.

Many of the things discussed here are precisely those that are more marginal and have not yet been compiled online, so keep this in mind when reading.

## Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT)

There is plenty of info on E and AAs and the like online. Info can be added here, but I am interested in more niche things here at the moment.

TL;DR: 
There are a few main things:

- Estrogen levels: typically raised by taking some of Estradiol, via pills, gels, patches or injection.
- Androgen levels: typically lowered either by having sufficiently high estrogen levels, or surpressed using an anti-androgen
- Progesterone: optional in transition, can affect mood and maybe breast growth, read [this research post](https://papers.lgbt/papers/prog){.source-link}
- Other: includes things like SERMs - used to reduce breast growth, or DHT blockers - used to reduce male pattern baldness and body hair growth while testosterone is high.

You would be much better off reading a better guide, such as this [Practical Guide to Feminization](https://pghrt.diy/){.source-link} or more detailed specialised websites, guides, including sourcing:

### Home-brewing

In terms of safety, the general wisdom is that: pharmaceutical grade > reputable home-brewer > personally home-brewing.

However, if you have no other option, brewing at home from raws is possible. 

A good page for learning about this is this [Homebrewing Wiki Page](https://hrtcafe.net/Homebrew/){.source-link}. 

## Fat Redistribution and Weight Cycling

Weight Cycling is the process of repetitively gaining and subsequently losing weight.

Typically when on HRT, it takes a long time for fat to redistribute to the desired places. The turnover rate for adipocyte cells at a constant bodyweight is about 10% per year, with half of the adipocytes being replaced every ~8.3 years on average. 

Some have suggested that weight cycling when on HRT can lead to getting results sooner.

Links:

 * [Mesityl - MTF Weight Cycling](https://mesityl.substack.com/p/mtf-weight-cycling){ .source-link }
    * A good introduction on the topic, covers many of the things below, has more sources cited, and also discusses some things to avoid.

### Downcycle

In the down cycle, the aim is to have a caloric deficit, and hopefully pull more fat from "undesired places" rather than from relatively desireable places.

### Maintining a caloric deficit

Depending on the person, it may be difficult to keep a caloric deficit. There are some things that can help with this:


### Maintining a Caloric Deficit

#### Caloric Deficit through Diets

Different diets seem to work for different people There is a lot of writing on this, do whatever works for you to maintain a deficit. 

Waterfasting works for some (ie: do not eat for multiple days in a row, only have water and micronutrient supplements). Potato diet works for others. Keto diet works for others again. Whole food plant based works for different people. This has a lot of variation for different people.

#### Water-soluble fibres
such as Psyllium Husk or Glucomannan are effective at filling up the stomach/digestive tract and promoting a feeling of fullness, reducing appetite and promoting weight loss. 

#### GLP-1 Agonists
There are various GLP-1 receptor agonists drugs like semaglutide, liraglutide, dulaglutide, exenatide, and tirzepatide. These promote weight loss through increasing insulin release, decreasing insulin resistance and decreasing excessive glucagon release. Their biggest downsides include very high price and the only viable RoA being injection.

#### Corset diet. 

Wearing a corset can also reduce appetite. You can do this in addition to [Waist Training](#waist-training) to also further reduce wasit-to-hip ratio in the mean time. See section that for more info.

### Down cyle - Burning the right fat

#### Aminophylline

Aminophylline is a compound of the bronchodilator theophylline with ethylenediamine in a 2:1 ratio. Its most common use is in the treatment of airway obstruction from asthma or COPD. It has been shown to inhibit dual phosphodiesterase (PDE) which causes cAMP to surge, and thus increase lipolysis.


* [Link to Meta-analysis](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9978326/){ .source-link }

In particular, [one study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17391155/){.source-link} on 25 men/women, when on a 1200kcal diet, achieved a reduction in waist circumference of 11 ± 1.0 cm when using 0.5% aminophylline, compared to a reduction of 5.0 ± 0.6 cm in the control group.

There are also various studies on thigh circumference reduction, where it seems like weight loss is a key component.

There is a small but existent discussion of this online. Here a I could find:

[link](https://www.boundtree.com/pharmaceuticals/rx-pharmaceuticals/aminophylline-25mg-ml-20ml-vial/p/5922-01)

#### Glycyrrhetinic acid

Much less discussed than aminophylline. 

There is like one study from 2005 which seems to suggest a small reduction in a month without negligible weight loss, and it seems like nobody has tried to replicate it:

- [Paper on 9 treatment + 9 control patients](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15894038/){.source-link}

> Weight (kg), before -> after
> 
> * treated: 60.5 ± 0.6 -> 60.2 ± 0.6 kg
> * placebo: 59.2 ± 0.4 -> 59.0 ± 0.4 kg
>
> Circumference at middle of thigh (cm), before --> after:
>
> * treated thigh: 52.7 ± 1.0 --> 52.4 ± 1.0
> * untreated thigh: 52.9 ± 1.4 --> 52.8 ± 1.4 
> * placebo thigh: 51.9 ± 1.0 --> 51.8 ± 1.0
> * untreated thigh: 51.1 ± 0.9 --> 51.2 ± 0.9
> 
> TLDR: 0.3cm difference after 1 month of applying 80mg 2.5% GA daily. minimal change in weight (~0.3kg)

Other studies seem mostly to be in vitro, eg:
- [in vitro lipolysis study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0006291X12005384){.source-link}

There is even less discussion of GA online/on reddit:
- [Reddit post from u/Lopsided_Bar2863 on r/4tran4 on aminophylline and glycyrrhetinic acid](https://old.reddit.com/r/4tran4/comments/1eq12mv/poons_theres_a_lifesaver_to_reduce_your_ass/){.source-link}

#### Topical Caffeine

Caffeine appears to affect the same PDE pathway as aminophylline, but there are not many studies using just caffeine.

Some examples:

* [study on 7% caffeine for cellulite](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17524126/){.source-link}
> "They were told to apply it in just one leg (thigh and hip) in order to keep the other one as control. The solution was applied twice daily (morning and night), and the dose was ∼15 mL per leg (thigh)."
>
> "99 completed the protocol"
> 
> "A 30-day treatment with this caffeine solution showed statistical significance concerning the reduction of circumference in treated thighs. This reduction was observed in more than 80% of the patients and was of about 2.1 cm in the thicker portion of the thigh and 1.7 cm in the lower portion. The use of 7% caffeine solution was also statistically significant in the reduction of hip circumference in 67.7% of the treated patients."

* [study on 3.5% caffeine for cellulite](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26082579/){.source-link}
> Thigh and upper-arm circumferences decreased by 0.7 cm (1.7%) and 0.8 cm (2.3%), respectively, at week 6. (No control was provided).


* [Study on caffeine + retinol + carnitine + others](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3933246/){.source-link}
> Maintain usual diet + twice daily (caffeine + retinol + carnitine + others).
> 12 weeks treatment:
> 
> Abdomen: −1.1cm (vs −0.4cm)
> Thighs: -0.8cm (vs −0.3cm)
> Hips: −0.8cm (vs −0.4cm)

#### Selective Muscle training
Strength training of specific muscles (e.g. the abdominals) prior to endurance training (e.g. a long cardio session) might be able to selectively burn fat in the corresponding area – this could be useful when trying to achieve a lower WHR.


#### Acetyl-l-carnitine (ALCAR)

is an orally bioavailable form of carnitine which is involved in the carnitine shuttle and is vital to fat metabolism. Supplementation has been shown to improve rates of fat metabolism and weight loss.


#### Radiofrequency Electric Field

I haven't looked into it much.

- [Some study showing it made a difference](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27060936/){.source-link}

#### Other things NOT worth considering:

todo: add info here, or maybe not.

### The Upcycle - Growing the right fat (and muscle)

Gaining weight, with the hope that it grows in the "right places"

Just like with downcycling, there are a range of supplements that could be used to aid your upcycle…

#### Excercise

This should be obvious. If you aren't doing it, do this first. It is, for the most part, basically free.

If trying to get a wider hips, lower body exercises such as trapbar deadlifts or hip thrusts would help increase hip circumference, and would improve both your waist-to-hip ratio and shoulder-to-hip ratio.

Exercise can reduces waist circumference independent of body-weight change—i.e., you can gain/maintain weight from lean mass while the waist still shrinks (android fat/visceral fat falls).

There are many different influencers who will tell you their own routine. For the most part, do what is easy. I personally reccomend to go to the gym maybe 2x per week, and focus on doing 3 sets of 8-12 reps of up to 2-3 main exercises. This should be sufficient for significant improvement while not taking too much time.

For larger glutes, hip thrust or squats work pretty well. I also like to throw in romanian trap-bar deadlift as it catches most muscles and progress is very visible. It doesn't matter too much, ask your favourite LLM for a simple routine and just follow it for 3 months.


### Weight gain supplements

#### Pioglitazone
"pio" is an anti-diabetic medication that activates PPAR-gamma systemically, reducing insulin resistance, gluconeogenesis and overall blood sugar. High insulin resistance in transgender females is associated with android fat distribution/higher WHR. It has been shown to lower visceral fat and WHR even in patients who’s overall BMI remained the same.

It seems to protect subcutaneous fat in a way similar to estrogen. There has even been one documented case of pioglitazone use to achieve female fat distribution in a transgender patient in the medical literature. The drug would probably be beneficial regardless of whether you are cycling or not.

Out of everything I have mentioned this is in my opinion probably the single most effective tool for achieving female fat distribution.

It has been associated with some risks to kidneys, but for short-term use it should generally be fine.

Typically people take it orally, but there are some reports of taking it topically:
* [Topical Pio + AH38](https://old.reddit.com/r/DIYCosmeticProcedures/comments/1g4v3wp/topical_pioglitazone_ah38_for_lost_volume/){.source-link}

#### Acetyl-Hexapeptide-38 (Adifyline®)
Adifyline®, topically applied increases PGC-1α expression, stimulating adipogenesis and lipid accumulation as a consequence67 (in a way opposite to hexapeptide-39). Again, the local effect of the drug could be leveraged to selectively increase fat in certain areas and thus improve WHR/fat distribution.

In general, reports are pretty hit-or-miss, unclear if due to application method differences or genetic differences or both. There is like, one study on it:

 * [Adifyline Peptide Brochure](https://daltosur.com/media/documents/adifyline-peptidebrochure.pdf)

Stories from people:

 * [Reddit post on Adyfiline with information on dosing](https://old.reddit.com/r/DIYaesthetics/comments/1gt4n3m/adifyline_purchasingvolume_guide/){.source-link}, as well as [Follow up comments from the author](https://ihsoyct.github.io/index.html?backend=artic_shift&mode=comments&author=Gloomy-Scarcity-2197&limit=100&sort=desc&body=adifyline){.source-link}, seems to think it works.
 * [Other reddit post](https://old.reddit.com/r/DIYCosmeticProcedures/comments/1b46il3/adifyline_experimentation/){.source-link}, no method reported, didn't seem to work for them. 
 * [Other reddit post](https://old.reddit.com/r/DIYCosmeticProcedures/comments/18onbl8/adifyline_update_explanation/){.source-link}, strong positive results, reports increasing from A/B-cup to C-cup. "I made the mistake of putting it on my butt and I feel like an hourglass and I don’t like it perhaps because I wasn’t ready for such a transition"
 * 

Typical place to buy is on LotionCrafters:

* [lotioncrafters](https://lotioncrafter.com/collections/active-ingredients/products/adifyline)

#### Acetyl-Hexapeptide-39 (Silusyne®)

topically applied decreases PGC-1α expression, diminishing adipogenesis and lipid accumulation as a consequence. It could potentially be used topically to selectively reduce fat accumulation in certain areas and thus improve WHR/fat distribution.

However, there is, in general, very little literature on this. 

The [Mesityl - MTF Weight Cycling](https://mesityl.substack.com/p/mtf-weight-cycling){ .source-link } post has some discussion on this, and implies that it would work for the down cycle, though it could also make sense for the up cycle to inhibit growth in certain areas.


#### Volufiline

Volufiline is a patented cosmetic preparation containing Sarsapogenin which has been reported to stimulate adipocytic differentiation and adipogenesis by activation of PPAR-gamma. Similarly to the hexapeptide-38, it can be applied topically and perhaps even used synergistically.

* [Volufiline Brochure / Patent filing](/assets/volufiline.pdf)

Some recommend buying sarsapogenin directly:
 * [Reddit post on buying sarasapogenin](https://old.reddit.com/r/estrogel/comments/1bodb0k/dont_waste_money_on_volufiline_get_the_raw/){.source-link}

#### Leucine and Argenine 
Leucine and Argenine have been shown to be particularly effective at activating mTOR, a kinase that stimulates lipid synthesis and cell growth. 


## Bone Altering

### Waist-to-hip ratio

#### Waist-training
As another option, if looking particularly to improve WHR or get a more hour-glass figure, could be waist training. This can often reduce appetite while worn. This usually is done by causing the floating ribs 8-12 to shift inwards, and may cause some organs to move around. People who do it consider it safe but DYOR.

#### Dangerous Darth Method
This is a subtype of "waist training".

This method, labelled dangerous, by darth, involves following practices that are actively reccomended against in the FtM community when binding. may cause pain, costochondritis, cracked or fractured ribs, reduced lung capacity, lung or kidney damage from floating ribs etc. 

I have done so, and found that eventually I had some pain, and stopped, but I got some good results in the mean time.

For original information, see [Darthemofan Method Writeup](https://old.reddit.com/r/estrogel/comments/iod975/unrelated_darth_dangerous_experiments_diy_shrink/){ .source-link }

> * starting: 32" underbust
> * after a "few weeks": 29.5" immediately when removed, 30.5 after an hour
> * 3 weeks later: 29 inches underbust with the binder, 30.0 without
> * after 2 years on, 1 year off: 29.5" stable


#### Rib reshaping surgery

As a most extreme option, you may consider rib-reshaping surgery. However from what I have read, it doesn't seem like it has a more substantial effect than the two above methods, albeit being able to so in a shorter timespan and maybe the effects are more permanent.

The surgery involves breaking the ribs and reshaping using a corset. Usually only targets lower floaring ribs (10-12). Basically same effect as corset but longer-lasting / doesn't need continuous maintenence.

See [Reddit wiki](https://old.reddit.com/r/TransSurgeriesWiki/wiki/other#wiki_rib_reshaping) for more info.

* Article: [Rib Reshaping Better Than Rib Removal For Waistline Narrowing?](https://www.eppleyplasticsurgery.com/is-rib-reshaping-better-than-rib-removal-for-waistline-narrowing/){.source-link}

#### Rib removal surgery

I generally do not reccomend this. You may be able to achieve a better shape, but your ribs exist to protect your vital organs, and removing them stops them from being able to do so. 


## Skin

The most important tips:

- Wear SPF, cover up your skin, and wear hats and sunglasses to limit sun exposure which can cause premature aging.
- Use Retinol, and Hyaluronic acid for baby skin.
- Limit your alcohol intake and avoid tobacco, as well as hard drugs because they will age the fuck out of you.
- It also helps to keep an active lifestyle.

#### Sunscreen

The single most important thing is also the most boring. You should be applying sunscreen to your face everyday.

- [Sunscreen and prevention of skin aging: a randomized trial](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23732711/){.source-link}

> regular use of sunscreen compared with discretionary use
>
> Skin aging from baseline to the end of the trial was 24% less in the daily sunscreen group than in the discretionary sunscreen group

- [Daily Use of a Facial Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Over One-Year Significantly Improves Clinical Evaluation of Photoaging](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27749441/){.source-link}

>  Clinical evaluations showed that all photoaging parameters improved significantly from baseline as early as Week 12 and the amelioration continued until Week 52. Skin texture, clarity, and mottled and discrete pigmentation were the most improved parameters by the end of the study (40% to 52% improvement from baseline), with 100% of subjects showing improvement in skin clarity and texture

You should wear sunscreen even if you only stay indoors but next to a window, as UVA is only partially blocked through glass, and can still have effects on aging of skin.

You should likely prefer chemical sunscreen filters (rather than mineral ones). US FDA has banned most of the best sun blocking ingredients, so it is better to get ones not non-US ones. East Asian and Australian SPF products are generally the highest regarded.

Sunscreen protects against UVA (320–400 nm) and UVB (290–320 nm) radiation. 

If you want to really optimise, most sunscreens are quite weak in the 380-400nm range, but there are two options that help here. The first is Iron Oxides, which have the downside of having a tint and thus being visible on the skin. The other option is [Mexoryl 400](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methoxypropylamino_cyclohexenylidene_ethoxyethylcyanoacetate){.source-link}, which is particularly effective in the 360−400 nm range, but is still under patent by L'Oréal.

Thus, the best 




#### Retinoids

Eg: Retinol, Retialdehyde, Tretinoin

Causes skin to churn more often, and makes it more fresh.

#### Matrixyl (palmitoyl peptides)
Some small, industry-adjacent trials show modest wrinkle improvements; evidence is promising but limited compared with retinoids. Safe to try as an add-on, just keep expectations realistic. 

For example:
- [see general study on peptides](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11762834){.source-link}


#### Callogen supplements
Multiple RCT meta-analyses show modest benefits for skin hydration/elasticity after ~8–12 weeks. Source seems less important than dose and hydrolysis.

### Avoiding scarring

If cut, there is potential research on avoiding scar tissue from forming.

#### Verteporfin

Unknown efficacy. Inhibits YAP/TAZ pathways. May be used to reduce scarring, but at the cost of increasing skin aging. There may one day exist other ways to induce TAP/TAZ (or downstream reduce cGAS–STING activation) that reduce sking aging.

## Other chemicals

#### CJC-1295

CJC-1295 DAC, also known as DAC:GRF, is a synthetic peptide analogue of growth hormone-releasing hormone and a growth hormone secretagogue. It is a modified form of GHRH with improved pharmacokinetics, especially in regard to half-life.

- [article about it](https://allaboutpeptides.com/cjc-1295-peptide/){.source-link}
- [post about it on Reddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/DrWillPowers/comments/uh22mo/cjc1295_wdac_effect_on_breast_growth_and_surgery/){.source-link}

#### ipamorelin

Ipamorelin is a peptide selective agonist of the ghrelin/growth hormone secretagogue receptor and a growth hormone secretagogue. It is a pentapeptide with the amino acid sequence Aib-His-D-2-Nal-D-Phe-Lys-NH₂ that was derived from GHRP-1. Ipamorelin significantly increases plasma growth hormone levels in both animals and humans. In addition, ipamorelin stimulates body weight gain in animals

#### tesmorelin

Tesamorelin is a synthetic hormone used to reduce excess abdominal fat in adults with HIV-associated lipodystrophy. It is administered via subcutaneous injection and requires a prescription from a doctor.

I have seen one report of someone injecting 6/3/3mg mix of tesmorelin/cjc1295/ipamorelin vial into belly fat.

> The cjc1295, I inject into belly fat, a 6/3/3mg mix of tesmorelin/cjc1295/ipamorelin vial. A few minutes after the injection, I can feel a headrush, and any soreness recovery from exercise appears to happen within hours, however there may be soreness in the breasts from tissues expanding.

#### igf-1 DES

Des(1-3)IGF-1 is a truncated form of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) that has enhanced potency compared to IGF-1 due to its reduced binding to insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins. It is used in research and has potential therapeutic applications, particularly in growth-related conditions

> I inject the igf-1 DES in the right breast area as the lymphatic system drains into the left side if I understand it correctly. The DES modification of igf-1 is very potent and activates all the growth receptors, including insulin receptors. The half life isn't very long, but the effect is noticable. About 0.05mL at a time, twice a day, from a 2mL of bacteriostatic water in a 1mg igf-1 DES vial.


#### kisspeptin 

Kisspeptin stimulates production of GnRH, FSH and LH and is much cheaper than (prescription-only) injectable FSH (follitropin). Can lead to additional breast growth.

FSH seems to help with breast growth.

LH stimulates production of testosterone by testicles, so this would need to be controlled, eg, with bicalutamide.


Example dosage:
> 5mg/3ml 0.05 ml thrice a week (injections with insulin syringes with needles 8 mm into fat on thigh, buttock or arm, not abdomen)

### Things to Avoid

#### Alcohol Consumption

Moderate alcohol consumption increases abdominal fat, worsening fat distribution, and increases plasma androgens in cisgender females. Therefore it is highly discouraged.


## Face

#### Suncream

Most obvious, shuldn't even need to say it, but do apply suncream to face every day.

#### Retinoids

Retinol (weak) and Tretinoin (strong)

#### Red light therapy

Some early results says it helps.

#### Other things

Hylauranic acids, Niacinamide, Vitamin C, Glycolic Acids, etc... probably help and combine to have a good effect, but not as huge an effect.

#### Face Plumpness

HRT helps. Otherwise, look at Adyfiline, Volufiline, and such. See above.


## Body Hair

There are a few main methods of hair removal:

#### Shaving

This one is obvious. Doesn't last very long

#### Waxing

Also obvious, lasts longer but non-permanent

#### Hair Removal Creams

This can lighten and thin out the hair somewhat, also temporary

#### Laser Hair Removal

This is more peramanent than other methods, and involves damaging your hair follicles with lasers. Typical is to do ~8 sessions spaced apart by 4 weeks. Depends a lot on skin type and hair colour. Dark hair + light skin works the best. 

Still requires top ups after the 8 sessions.

Most find the pain tollerable / not that bad, but if you have particularly sensitive skin and find that after the session is was too unpleasant, there are things you can take to releave pain topically:

#### Electrolysis

Most permanent method, involves actually killing the hair follicles with electricity. Most expensive and painful option.



## Hair

### General care

See reddit tbh I ain't bothered to write it all here.

* [Reddit r/HaircareScience Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/wiki/index/)

#### Fringe

A common strategy in the MtF trans community to "improve shaping of the face" is to get a fringe. 


### Prevent loss / regain growth

#### Finasteride / Dutasteride

Decreases DHT levels to prevent hair loss (NOT an anti-androgen) and is associated with mental health effects. See other websites for this, these are common.

#### Minoxidil

Promotes hair growth. See other website for this, also quite common. (or someone else please update this)

#### Topical Estrogen (without feminization)
> try to wash your face 5 minutes after applying [5 mg/ml estriol serum]: this will only allow the shunt pathway (ie through hair follicules) maximizing the effect on follicules and therefore the pores, without allowing normal transdermal absorption
> this method is used by men using E2 to regrow hair without systemic side effects (like boobs) and is supported by papers I read (search the sub for the shunt pathway)

I haven't looked much at this. See [comment in this unrelated reddit post](https://old.reddit.com/r/estrogel/comments/1bodb0k/dont_waste_money_on_volufiline_get_the_raw/){.source-link}

### PP405

PP405, a currently-under-research compound currently in clinical trials for hair growth.

#### Stop and Go method

Some people have considered stopping estrogen temporarily, then restarting is, as a method to try to "reduce estrogen sensitivity".

This person tried it and it seemed to work for them:

#### Progesterone

[Research post on Progesterone](https://papers.lgbt/papers/prog){.source-link}

> “after 6–12 months” is a reasonable default
>
> if your goal is to maximize the ductal scaffold before layering alveolar fullness, wait for budding, then consider progesterone, understanding that its volumetric benefit is unproven and may be subtle or person‑specific

??? note "Notes on Progesterone"

    > 1. Injectable progesterone is short-acting, must be injected daily.
    > Oral progesterone is ineffective because most of it is converted to allopregnanolone which common blood tests confuse with progesterone.
    > Neovagina absorbs meds not as well as a cis-woman's vagina.
    > Most progestins give various side effects.
    > Hydroxyprogesterone caproate is not bioidentical.
    > It's not converted in the body to progesterone (unlike estradiol valerate and estradiol enanthate).
    > 
    > 2. Progesterone decreases rate of synthesis of estrogen receptors.
    > Cis-women are supposed to benefit from that, but goals of MtF are opposite.
    >
    > 3. Estradiol develops ducts in milk glands, progesterone develops alveoles.
    > Most of breast volume is ducts and connective tissue between them.
    > If an alveole formed (at the end of a duct), that duct will not grow in length anymore. > So, progesterone and Androcur can stunt breast growth.
    >
    > 4. Progestogens increase risk of prolactinoma and meningioma (brain tumors).
    > Progestogens (especially cyproterone acetate), not estrogens (despite mistaken rumor among medical professionals).
    >
    > I advise NOT to add progesterone for at least 3 years since starting estradiol injections at least 40 mg/month (not since the very beginning of HRT).
    >
    > Or never take progestogens. In cases of complete androgen insensitivity (CAIS),
    > XY women develop rather spectacularly feminine secondary sexual characteristics though nothing in their bodies makes progesterone.

## Voice

#### Voice Training

There are many different resources. Maybe try a few of these guides:

- Lena [Shortcut to female voice](http://lena.kiev.ua/voice/){.source-link}
- alyssavt [No explanations, just instructions! (feminizing)](https://buymeacoffee.com/alyssavt/no-explanations-instructions-feminizing){.source-link}
- TransVoiceLessons [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@TransVoiceLessons) and [BEGINNERS Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfCS01MkbIY)

- [Voice Training, Essentially](https://voicefem-essentially.carrd.co/){.source-link}

You can get an idea of how you are doing using the "Voice Tools" app (probably the most common app). It mostly just measures pitch though:

- [VoiceTools iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/voice-tools/id1447495900)


### Vocal Feminisation Surgery

If wanting permanent results with less voice training, surgery is an option. Note that recovery can be quite difficult (eg: not speaking for 2 weeks - 2 months) and in general one retains more optionality/pitch if one trains. 

In addition, one will sitll be required to do some amount of voice training even if you get surgery, otherwise your voice will sound somewhat unnatrual.

From Reddit, it seems like Yeson Voice Center in South Korea is the best place to get it done.

Here is an overview of some of the main methods.

* [ChatGPT Comparison](/sources/chatgpt_vfs.html){.source-link}


#### Cricothyroid Approximation (CTA)

CTA was the first widely used pitch-raising procedure. Outcomes with CTA are less reliable and often less natural-sounding than other methods. Many patients’ voices acquire an unnaturally high or “falsetto” quality after CTA.

#### Wendler Glottoplasty (Anterior Glottic Web Formation)

Wendler glottoplasty is performed through the mouth, no external incisions, and physically shortens the vibratory length of the vocal folds. The surgeon removes or thins the epithelium (mucosal tissue) on the anterior (front) portion of both vocal folds and then stitches the front parts of the cords together, creating a small anterior web.

This permanently reduces the length of the vibrating portion of the folds (similar to how a shorter guitar string produces a higher pitch). The reduced length and resulting increased tension cause a higher fundamental frequency when speaking.

A notable variation of this is Yeson Voice Center’s VFSRAC technique in South Korea. This is probably the most highly regarded voice center I have read about.

#### Feminization Laryngoplasty (FemLar)

Feminization laryngoplasty is a more extensive surgical approach that physically reconstructs the larynx (voice box) to a smaller, more female size. it is an open-neck surgery combined with endoscopic work on the vocal folds.

Provides a comprehensive feminization of the voice. Because it addresses pitch and resonance. It is the most invasive option and thus carries greater risks and recovery demands. patients may lose both their lowest notes and a bit of their highest, leaving a narrower range.

## Preserving Fertility pre-HRT

### Sperm Cryopreservation

#### Ensuring quality

- Avoid heat at all costs. No to Sauna/Hottub. 
- Better to do in winter or spring, to avoid heat.
- Take zinc supplements
- Take omega 3 supplements
- Generally, require 2-4 days of abstinance before storage sessions.
- You usually need to be tested for STIs. 

#### Basics of Storage

Depending on where you are from, it can be annoying to freeze and store gametes. Typically this is done by finding an IVF clinic that allows storing of sperm. It is possible to move sperm between clinics, but generally it is probably better to choose somewhere with good success rates. Transfer between countries can be difficult. You will generally need to pay an annual storage fee on the order of €200-400/year depending on the place.

The success rates are usually measured as pregnancies in <35yo women, <40yo women, and >40yo women. In a decent place, rated for <35to women are usually around a ~50% chance. Each place likes to measure and report different things though. Also note that most people who do IVF do so because they have fertlity issues, so most likely your rate of success will be higher. If a clinic has "donor success rates" that is usually more representitive. These success rates can be improved with genetic screening methods like PGT-A, and some nombers include it and some don't, but is getting more common (though also usually costs extra).

Main methods are In-Vitro Fertilization (IVF) (incl ICSI), where one does fertilisation in vitro, and In-Utero Insemination (IUI), more affordable but less reliable.

Depending on your sperm quality, you will probably need to have multiple storage sessions. You can store anywhere between 1 and ~5 straws in a single session, each typically good for 1 round of IFV, but may need multiple straws for an IUI session. (IUI is typically far less expensive). Typical is 2-3 sessions, but more can also happen.


### Where to Store Gametes

In places like UK and Ireland, the process is kinda slow. As of 2025, most places in ireland no longer offer male gamete cryopreservation without a doctor's note due to storage shortage. UK is hit-or-miss with clinics, and in my experience you will be waiting months to do it.

There are some good IVF clinics in Spain which are worth considering, such as IVI or Instituto Bernabeu, which are much faster, with the drawback of needing to spend a week or two in Spain.

## Methods when trying to preserve fertility

In general, HRT has the most significant effects. However, if you really require not being on it (eg: for fertlity reasons, such as waiting to do gamete storage, or if temporarily stopping HRT to regain fertility), there are some things you can still do, though generally the effects will be less pronounced.

I have read some reports of people applying estrogel on the scalp and washing if off within 5 minutes to have some effect without raising blood estrogen levels too significantly, but there is likely more research that could be done. See link below for some ideas.
