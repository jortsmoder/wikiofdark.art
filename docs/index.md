# Wiki of Dark Arts

## What is this?

This is a dump of some things I have on looksmaxxing your transition. Some things are far more researched than others. Some things are way more important, and some things have marginal benefits at best. Some things are much safer than others. Everything is currently a work in progress. This wiki, as it currently stands, mostly assumes male-to-female transitioning. 

Some links I have read in less detail than others (see why [reading abstracts alone may be insufficient](https://labmuffin.com/why-you-cant-trust-study-abstracts/){.source-link}). I wrote this as there was no complete guide to all these techniques, many of which are super niche. In it's current state, it is more of a jumping off point into things you may not have heard of, and my hope is this will evolve into a page that becomes more trustworthy over time.

This site is best viewed on desktop, where source link will open an archived version to the side of the page. Opening a link in new tab will open the original page.

## How should I start?

In general, if you are new, the order I would recommend is approximately:

1. Start trying to do [gamete storage](#gamete-storage) (optional)
2. Start [permanent hair removal](#body-hair)
3. Once gamete storage done, [start HRT](#hormone-replacement-therapy-hrt)
4. Do [voice training](#voice)
5. Worry about other things (or possibly not, see how things go)

The only important part is that you do gamete storage before starting HRT (though it is possible to do so shortly after starting also). These topics have the most discussion online, and likely this wiki will not have all the information you need about 1 - 4.

Many of the things discussed here are precisely those that are more marginal and have not yet been compiled online, so keep this in mind when reading.

#### Updating this website

## Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT)

There is plenty of info on E and AAs and the like online. Info can be added here, but I am interested in more niche things here at the moment.


### HRT TL;DR

There are a few main things:

- Estrogen levels: typically raised by taking some of Estradiol, via pills, gels, patches or injection. Eg, see [dosing guide](https://papers.lgbt/papers/dosing){.source-link}
- Androgen levels: typically lowered either by having sufficiently high estrogen levels, or surpressed using an anti-androgen
- Progesterone: optional in transition, can affect mood and maybe breast growth, read [this research post](https://papers.lgbt/papers/prog){.source-link}
- Other: includes things like SERMs - used to reduce breast growth, or DHT blockers - used to reduce male pattern baldness and body hair growth while testosterone is high.

Most important is to make sure androgen levels are sufficiently lowered. Here is a [reasonable timeline of effects](https://papers.lgbt/papers/roadmap){.source-link}

You would be much better off reading a better guide, such as this [Practical Guide to Feminization](https://pghrt.diy/){.source-link} or more detailed specialised websites, guides, including sourcing:

- [https://diyhrt.market/](https://diyhrt.market/)
- [https://diyhrt.info/](https://diyhrt.info/)
- [https://diyhrt.wiki/](https://diyhrt.wiki/)
- [https://transfemscience.org/](https://transfemscience.org/)

#### Gamete storage

You will probably lose fertility if you start HRT. If you potentially want to have kids, you should probably do gamete storage prior to starting. (If starting old enough, it is usually possible to regain fertility by temporarily stopping hrt for 3-6months but sometimes it takes longer). 
Alternatively, you can sometimes preserve fertility if doing bicalutamide mono-therapy (results unclear).

You can read some [vague notes here](/sources/_gamete_storage.html){.source-link} if going down this path.
If you are doing gamete storage, you may be able to get some limited feminizing effects before storage (see [some ideas from ChatGPT](/sources/chatgpt_no_hrt.html){.source-link}), or doing [Waist training](#waist-training) or similar, but generally most results come from HRT.

### Home-brewing

In terms of safety, the general wisdom is that: pharmaceutical grade > reputable home-brewer > personally home-brewing.

However, if you have no other option, brewing at home from raws is possible. 

A good page for learning about this is this [Homebrewing Wiki Page](https://hrtcafe.net/Homebrew/){.source-link}. 

## Fat Redistribution and Weight Cycling

Weight Cycling is the process of repetitively gaining and subsequently losing weight.

Typically when on HRT, it takes a long time for fat to redistribute to the desired places. The turnover rate for adipocyte cells at a constant bodyweight is about 10% per year, with half of the adipocytes being replaced every ~8.3 years on average. 

This naive estimate is misleading, and studies seem to find redistribution effects way earlier than you'd expect if it acted via turnover. (People often gain weight after starting HRT so this may accout for some of this). Some still suggest that weight cycling when on HRT can lead to getting results sooner.

Links:

 * [Mesityl - MTF Weight Cycling](https://mesityl.substack.com/p/mtf-weight-cycling){ .source-link }
    * A good introduction on the topic, covers many of the things below, has more sources cited, and also discusses some things to avoid.

### Downcycle

In the down cycle, the aim is to have a caloric deficit, and hopefully pull more fat from "undesired places" rather than from relatively desireable places.

### Maintaining a caloric deficit

Depending on the person, it may be difficult to keep a caloric deficit. There are some things that can help with this:


### Maintaining a Caloric Deficit

#### Caloric Deficit through Diets

Different diets seem to work for different people There is a lot of writing on this, do whatever works for you to maintain a deficit. 

Waterfasting works for some (ie: do not eat for multiple days in a row, only have water and micronutrient supplements). Potato diet works for others. Keto diet works for others again. Whole food plant based works for different people. This has a lot of variation for different people.

#### Water-soluble fibres
such as Psyllium Husk or Glucomannan are effective at filling up the stomach/digestive tract and promoting a feeling of fullness, reducing appetite and promoting weight loss. 

#### GLP-1 Agonists
There are various GLP-1 receptor agonists drugs like semaglutide, liraglutide, dulaglutide, exenatide, and tirzepatide. These promote weight loss through increasing insulin release, decreasing insulin resistance and decreasing excessive glucagon release. Their biggest downsides include very high price if gotten through traditional medical channels, and the only viable method of administration being injection. My vibe-based understanding is that newer drugs are strictly better, and mostly either get fewer side effects for similar results, or get similar side effects for better results. Read more in links

Here are some guides:

- [Comparison of sources of GLP Drugs](https://www.finnrick.com/)
- [Long post discussing GLP Drugs](https://www.cremieux.xyz/p/how-to-get-cheap-ozempic){.source-link}
- [Sleep, Diet, Exercise and GLP-1 Drugs](https://thezvi.substack.com/p/sleep-diet-exercise-and-glp-1-drugs){.source-link}

For some discussion on people's experiences, you can read online. Read for example:

- [30 days on retatrutide](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/mLvek6a9G86EnhJqH/30-days-of-retatrutide){.source-link}
- [a 9-week trip on retatrutide](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/J8nvbu5AFqR5ysSDR/a-9-week-trip-on-retatrutide){.source-link}

#### Corset diet. 

Wearing a corset can also reduce appetite. You can do this in addition to [Waist Training](#waist-training) to also further reduce waist-to-hip ratio in the mean time. See section that for more info.

### Down cyle - Burning the right fat

#### Aminophylline

Aminophylline is a compound of the bronchodilator theophylline with ethylenediamine in a 2:1 ratio. Its most common use is in the treatment of airway obstruction from asthma or COPD. It has been shown to inhibit dual phosphodiesterase (PDE) which causes cAMP to surge, and thus increase lipolysis.


* [Link to Meta-analysis](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9978326/){ .source-link }

In particular, [one study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17391155/){.source-link} on 25 men/women, when on a 1200kcal diet, achieved a reduction in waist circumference of 11 ± 1.0 cm when using 0.5% aminophylline, compared to a reduction of 5.0 ± 0.6 cm in the control group.

There are also various studies on thigh circumference reduction, where it seems like weight loss is a key component.

There is a small but existent discussion of this online. Here a I could find:

??? note "Sourcing, according to ChatGPT"

    You can order **raw aminophylline powder** from laboratory-chemical vendors, while medical distributors will only supply it under a prescription or professional license.  

    Research / lab‐grade suppliers (no prescription, “for research use only”):

[link](https://www.boundtree.com/pharmaceuticals/rx-pharmaceuticals/aminophylline-25mg-ml-20ml-vial/p/5922-01)

#### Glycyrrhetinic acid

Much less discussed than aminophylline. 

There is like one study from 2005 which seems to suggest a small reduction in a month without negligible weight loss, and it seems like nobody has tried to replicate it:

- [Paper on 9 treatment + 9 control patients](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15894038/){.source-link}

> Weight (kg), before -> after
> 
> * treated: 60.5 ± 0.6 -> 60.2 ± 0.6 kg
> * placebo: 59.2 ± 0.4 -> 59.0 ± 0.4 kg
>
> Circumference at middle of thigh (cm), before --> after:
>
> * treated thigh: 52.7 ± 1.0 --> 52.4 ± 1.0
> * untreated thigh: 52.9 ± 1.4 --> 52.8 ± 1.4 
> * placebo thigh: 51.9 ± 1.0 --> 51.8 ± 1.0
> * untreated thigh: 51.1 ± 0.9 --> 51.2 ± 0.9
> 
> TLDR: 0.3cm difference after 1 month of applying 80mg 2.5% GA daily. minimal change in weight (~0.3kg)

Other studies seem mostly to be in vitro, eg:
- [in vitro lipolysis study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0006291X12005384){.source-link}

There is even less discussion of GA online/on reddit:
- [Reddit post from u/Lopsided_Bar2863 on r/4tran4 on aminophylline and glycyrrhetinic acid](https://old.reddit.com/r/4tran4/comments/1eq12mv/poons_theres_a_lifesaver_to_reduce_your_ass/){.source-link}

#### Topical Caffeine

Caffeine appears to affect the same PDE pathway as aminophylline, but there are not many studies using just caffeine.

Some examples:

* [study on 7% caffeine for cellulite](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17524126/){.source-link}
> "They were told to apply it in just one leg (thigh and hip) in order to keep the other one as control. The solution was applied twice daily (morning and night), and the dose was ∼15 mL per leg (thigh)."
>
> "99 completed the protocol"
> 
> "A 30-day treatment with this caffeine solution showed statistical significance concerning the reduction of circumference in treated thighs. This reduction was observed in more than 80% of the patients and was of about 2.1 cm in the thicker portion of the thigh and 1.7 cm in the lower portion. The use of 7% caffeine solution was also statistically significant in the reduction of hip circumference in 67.7% of the treated patients."

* [study on 3.5% caffeine for cellulite](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26082579/){.source-link}
> Thigh and upper-arm circumferences decreased by 0.7 cm (1.7%) and 0.8 cm (2.3%), respectively, at week 6. (No control was provided).


* [Study on caffeine + retinol + carnitine + others](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3933246/){.source-link}
> Maintain usual diet + twice daily (caffeine + retinol + carnitine + others).
> 12 weeks treatment:
> 
> Abdomen: −1.1cm (vs −0.4cm)
> Thighs: -0.8cm (vs −0.3cm)
> Hips: −0.8cm (vs −0.4cm)

#### Selective Muscle training
Strength training of specific muscles (e.g. the abdominals) prior to endurance training (e.g. a long cardio session) might be able to selectively burn fat in the corresponding area – this could be useful when trying to achieve a lower WHR.


#### Acetyl-l-carnitine (ALCAR)

is an orally bioavailable form of carnitine which is involved in the carnitine shuttle and is vital to fat metabolism. Supplementation has been shown to improve rates of fat metabolism and weight loss.


#### Radiofrequency Electric Field

I haven't looked into it much.

- [Some study showing it made a difference](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27060936/){.source-link}

#### Other things NOT worth considering:

todo: add info here, or maybe not.

### The Upcycle - Growing the right fat (and muscle)

Gaining weight, with the hope that it grows in the "right places"

Just like with downcycling, there are a range of supplements that could be used to aid your upcycle…

#### Excercise

This should be obvious. If you aren't doing it, do this first. It is, for the most part, basically free.

If trying to get a wider hips, lower body exercises such as trapbar deadlifts or hip thrusts would help increase hip circumference, and would improve both your waist-to-hip ratio and shoulder-to-hip ratio.

Exercise can reduces waist circumference independent of body-weight change—i.e., you can gain/maintain weight from lean mass while the waist still shrinks (android fat/visceral fat falls).

There are many different influencers who will tell you their own routine. For the most part, do what is easy. I personally recommend to go to the gym maybe 2x per week, and focus on doing 3 sets of 8-12 reps of up to 2-3 main exercises. This should be sufficient for significant improvement while not taking too much time.

For larger glutes, hip thrust or squats work pretty well. I also like to throw in romanian trap-bar deadlift as it catches most muscles and progress is very visible. It doesn't matter too much, ask your favourite LLM for a simple routine and just follow it for 3 months.


### Weight gain supplements

#### Thiazolidinediones (TZDs)
One can take TZDs, most commonly Pioglitazone or "pio", though there exists others such as Rosiglitazone.

##### Pioglitazone
"Pio" is an anti-diabetic medication that activates PPAR-gamma systemically, reducing insulin resistance, gluconeogenesis and overall blood sugar. High insulin resistance in transgender females is associated with android fat distribution/higher WHR. It has been shown to lower visceral fat and WHR even in patients who’s overall BMI remained the same.

It seems to protect subcutaneous fat in a way similar to estrogen. There has even been one documented case of pioglitazone use to achieve female fat distribution in a transgender patient in the medical literature. The drug would probably be beneficial regardless of whether you are cycling or not.

Out of everything I have mentioned this is in my opinion probably the single most effective tool for achieving female fat distribution.

It has been associated with some risks to kidneys, but for short-term use it should generally be fine.

Typically people take it orally, but there are some reports of taking it topically:
* [Topical Pio + AH38](https://old.reddit.com/r/DIYCosmeticProcedures/comments/1g4v3wp/topical_pioglitazone_ah38_for_lost_volume/){.source-link}

Here is a research post on pio:
* [pioglitazone and the role of thiazolidinediones in the case of non-hormone transitional care for male to female transsexuals](https://papers.lgbt/papers/pio){.source-link}

#### Acetyl-Hexapeptide-38 (Adifyline®)
Adifyline®, topically applied increases PGC-1α expression, stimulating adipogenesis and lipid accumulation as a consequence67 (in a way opposite to hexapeptide-39). Again, the local effect of the drug could be leveraged to selectively increase fat in certain areas and thus improve WHR/fat distribution.

In general, reports are pretty hit-or-miss, unclear if due to application method differences or genetic differences or both. There is like, one study on it:

 * [Adifyline Peptide Brochure](https://daltosur.com/media/documents/adifyline-peptidebrochure.pdf)

Stories from people:

 * [Reddit post on Adyfiline with information on dosing](https://old.reddit.com/r/DIYaesthetics/comments/1gt4n3m/adifyline_purchasingvolume_guide/){.source-link}, as well as [Follow up comments from the author](https://ihsoyct.github.io/index.html?backend=artic_shift&mode=comments&author=Gloomy-Scarcity-2197&limit=100&sort=desc&body=adifyline){.source-link}, seems to think it works.
 * [Other reddit post](https://old.reddit.com/r/DIYCosmeticProcedures/comments/1b46il3/adifyline_experimentation/){.source-link}, no method reported, didn't seem to work for them. 
 * [Other reddit post](https://old.reddit.com/r/DIYCosmeticProcedures/comments/18onbl8/adifyline_update_explanation/){.source-link}, strong positive results, reports increasing from A/B-cup to C-cup. "I made the mistake of putting it on my butt and I feel like an hourglass and I don’t like it perhaps because I wasn’t ready for such a transition"

Typical place to buy is on LotionCrafters:

* [https://lotioncrafters.com/](https://lotioncrafter.com/collections/active-ingredients/products/adifyline)

#### Acetyl-Hexapeptide-39 (Silusyne®)

topically applied decreases PGC-1α expression, diminishing adipogenesis and lipid accumulation as a consequence. It could potentially be used topically to selectively reduce fat accumulation in certain areas and thus improve WHR/fat distribution.

However, there is, in general, very little literature on this. 

The [Mesityl - MTF Weight Cycling](https://mesityl.substack.com/p/mtf-weight-cycling){ .source-link } post has some discussion on this, and implies that it would work for the down cycle, though it could also make sense for the up cycle to inhibit growth in certain areas.


#### Volufiline

Volufiline is a patented cosmetic preparation containing Sarsapogenin which has been reported to stimulate adipocytic differentiation and adipogenesis by activation of PPAR-gamma. Similarly to the hexapeptide-38, it can be applied topically and perhaps even used synergistically.

* [Volufiline Brochure / Patent filing](/assets/volufiline.pdf)

Some recommend buying sarsapogenin directly:

 * [Reddit post on buying sarasapogenin](https://old.reddit.com/r/estrogel/comments/1bodb0k/dont_waste_money_on_volufiline_get_the_raw/){.source-link}

#### Leucine and Argenine 
Leucine and Argenine have been shown to be effective at activating mTOR, a kinase that stimulates lipid synthesis and cell growth. I haven't looked deeply into this.

#### Growth Hormones and Various Peptides

There exist various other peptides and growth hormone related products that may help. I do not feel confident reccomending these as I have not read up on them (todo.) See the [section on these](#other-chemicals) for more info.

### Things to Avoid

#### Alcohol Consumption

Moderate alcohol consumption increases abdominal fat, worsening fat distribution, and increases plasma androgens in cisgender females. Therefore it is highly discouraged.


## Bone Altering

### Waist-to-hip ratio

#### Waist-training
As another option, if looking particularly to improve WHR or get a more hour-glass figure, could be waist training. This can often reduce appetite while worn. This usually is done by causing the floating ribs 8-12 to shift inwards, and may cause some organs to move around. People who do it consider it safe but DYOR.

#### Dangerous Darth Method
This is a subtype of "waist training" but for underbust.

This method, labelled dangerous, by darth, involves following practices that are actively reccomended against in the FtM community when binding. may cause pain, costochondritis, cracked or fractured ribs, reduced lung capacity, lung or kidney damage from floating ribs etc. 

I have done so, and found that eventually I had some pain, and stopped, but I got some good results in the mean time.

For original information, see [Darthemofan Method Writeup](https://old.reddit.com/r/estrogel/comments/iod975/unrelated_darth_dangerous_experiments_diy_shrink/){ .source-link }

> * starting: 32" underbust
> * after a "few weeks": 29.5" immediately when removed, 30.5 after an hour
> * 3 weeks later: 29 inches underbust with the binder, 30.0 without
> * after 2 years on, 1 year off: 29.5" stable


#### Rib reshaping surgery

As a most extreme option, you may consider rib-reshaping surgery. However from what I have read, it doesn't seem like it has a more substantial effect than the two above methods, albeit being able to so in a shorter timespan and maybe the effects are more permanent.

The surgery involves breaking the ribs and reshaping using a corset. Usually only targets lower floaring ribs (10-12). Basically same effect as corset but longer-lasting / doesn't need continuous maintenence.

See [Reddit wiki](https://old.reddit.com/r/TransSurgeriesWiki/wiki/other#wiki_rib_reshaping) for more info.

* Reddit: [Waist narrowing surgery by AnyaAnn in 2020](https://old.reddit.com/r/MtF/comments/g36qn0/waist_narrowing_surgery/){.source-link}

* Article: [Rib Reshaping Better Than Rib Removal For Waistline Narrowing?](https://www.eppleyplasticsurgery.com/is-rib-reshaping-better-than-rib-removal-for-waistline-narrowing/){.source-link}

#### Rib removal surgery

On vibes I do not reccomend this unless you really want it. You may be able to achieve a better shape, but your ribs exist to protect your vital organs, and removing them stops them from being able to do so. You also are likely to get significant scars on your torso. The shape you get is probably better than you would get from waist narrowing surgery.

#### Costal cartilage reduction

If wanting to surgically alter underbust, you can do a Costal cartilage reduction / rib osteotomies. Procedures like Ravitch Procedure were mostly invented for people with pectus excavatum (concave chest), and are quite rare to do for cosmetic reasons, and likely quite expensive.

There is [some discussion of this on reddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/4tran4/comments/1ovhl9b/this_surgery_for_pectus_excavatum_could_possibly/){.source-link} but it's quite uncommon. The only person who seems to do it is Dr Leif Rogers. For reshaping middle ribs you can also go to Dr Raul Manzaneda in Perú.

### Shoulders

#### Delt muscle atrophe

For smaller shoulder-to-hip ratio, get smaller delts. Do this by not exercising your delts in the gym. This would affect bideltoid shoulder width, but not bichromal shoulder width, which would becomde the main minimum width limitation. 

In general, it is much easier to gain hip width rather than lose shoulder width, so you should try to do that first.

#### Surgical Shortening

There are two main bones for your shoulders: in the front, the clavicle (collar bone), and in the back, the scapula (shoulder blades). 

You can lose ~2cm of shoulder width from each side through surgery. The surgery is generally quite minor but not often done, as the effects are not huge. 

Here is an example:

- [u/wyrecharm on reddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/14gmuq8/3_months_postop_clavicle_and_scapula_reduction/){.source-link}

clavicle shortening can give a bit of a hunched look. This is not something I would particularly reccomend, but I haven't spent that much time looking at this.

## Face

### Skin

The most important tips:

- Wear SPF, cover up your skin, and wear hats and sunglasses to limit sun exposure which can cause premature aging.
- Use Retinol, and Hyaluronic acid for baby skin.
- Limit your alcohol intake and avoid tobacco, as well as hard drugs because they will age the fuck out of you.
- It also helps to keep an active lifestyle.

#### Sunscreen

The single most important thing is also the most boring. You should be applying sunscreen to your face everyday.

- [Sunscreen and prevention of skin aging: a randomized trial](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23732711/){.source-link}

> regular use of sunscreen compared with discretionary use
>
> Skin aging from baseline to the end of the trial was 24% less in the daily sunscreen group than in the discretionary sunscreen group

- [Daily Use of a Facial Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Over One-Year Significantly Improves Clinical Evaluation of Photoaging](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27749441/){.source-link}

>  Clinical evaluations showed that all photoaging parameters improved significantly from baseline as early as Week 12 and the amelioration continued until Week 52. Skin texture, clarity, and mottled and discrete pigmentation were the most improved parameters by the end of the study (40% to 52% improvement from baseline), with 100% of subjects showing improvement in skin clarity and texture

You should wear sunscreen even if you only stay indoors but next to a window, as UVA is only partially blocked through glass, and can still have effects on aging of skin.

You should likely prefer chemical sunscreen filters (rather than mineral ones). US FDA has banned most of the best sun blocking ingredients, so it is better to get ones not non-US ones. East Asian and Australian SPF products are generally the highest regarded.

Sunscreen protects against UVA (320–400 nm) and UVB (290–320 nm) radiation. 

If you want to really optimise, most sunscreens are quite weak in the 380-400nm range, but there are two options that help here:

The first is Iron Oxides/Titanium Oxide, which have the downside of having a tint and thus being visible on the skin. These are rarely used in products for this reason.

> [**Wikipedia: Sunscreen**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunscreen#Inactive_ingredients){.source-link}
> Further research has shown that sunscreens with added iron oxide pigments and/or pigmentary titanium dioxide can provide the wearer with a substantial amount of HEVL protection.

The other option is [Mexoryl 400](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methoxypropylamino_cyclohexenylidene_ethoxyethylcyanoacetate){.source-link}, which is particularly effective in the 360−400 nm range, but is still under patent by L'Oréal.

Thus, the "best" suncreams are mostly from L'Oreal, such as La Roche Posay UVMune 400 products. See [review by Lab Muffin](https://labmuffin.com/la-roche-posay-uvmune-400-science-and-review/){.source-link}. But are somewhat on the pricer end. 

I have personally found korean and japanese have the best texture, and personally like SkinAqua products the most out of various things I have tried (especially SkinAqua UV Super Moisture milk, as it is unscented and has a pleasant texture). But I am no expert on this, you may be better trusting a real reviewer such as Lab Muffin.

If you want a flowchart, here is a nice one:

#### Retinoids

Eg: Retinol, Retialdehyde, Tretinoin

Causes skin to churn more often, and makes it more fresh.

#### Matrixyl (palmitoyl peptides)
Some small, industry-adjacent trials show modest wrinkle improvements; evidence is promising but limited compared with retinoids. Safe to try as an add-on, just keep expectations realistic. 

For example:

- [see general study on peptides](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11762834){.source-link}


#### Callogen supplements
Multiple RCT meta-analyses show modest benefits for skin hydration/elasticity after ~8–12 weeks. Source seems less important than dose and hydrolysis.

- [Effects of Oral Collagen for Skin Anti-Aging: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10180699/){.source-link}

#### Niacinamide, Ceramides, Panthenol

Help when skin barrier is damaged 

* u/darthemofan: ["What to do when you've damaged your skin barrier?"](https://old.reddit.com/r/skinwhitening/comments/1bet4iv/what_to_do_when_youve_damaged_your_skin_barrier/){.source-link}

#### laser resurfacing
todo: write this

#### microneedling
todo: write this

#### chemical peels
(eg: TCA Cross)
todo: write this

#### Red light therapy

Some early results says it helps.

#### Other things

Hylauranic acids, Niacinamide, Vitamin C, Glycolic Acids, etc... probably help and combine to have a good effect, but not as huge an effect.

### Facial Fat Distribution

HRT has substantial effects on facial fat distribution. 

Otherwise, look at [Adyfiline](#acetyl-hexapeptide-38-adifyline), [Volufiline](#volufiline), and such above.

### Facial Feminisation Surgery (FFS)

The face has some main parts, usually divided into something like this:

- hair line
- forehead
- browbone
- orbitals
- nose
- cheeks
- philtrum
- lips
- chin
- jaw

Here is a relatively good starting guide to FFS:

* [A comprehensive guide to FFS](https://stainedglasswoman.substack.com/p/face-first){.source-link}

FFS can get quite expensive quite quickly, and there are some surgeons more reputable than others, but no obvious picks. It is difficult to find surgeons who are well known to be good, have reasonable waiting times, and have reasonably prices. One must trade off on some of these. It can also be difficult to compare, as it is much more custom for different people.

Skin laxity may be an issue for a while. One will likely have some minor scarring but in pretty hidden places. One could use highly experimental [Verteporfin](/#verteporfin) treatment to attempt to reduce scarring maybe.

#### Surgery order

Before getting FFS, some surgeons reccomend extracting any wisdom teeth (see: [DB article on this](https://deschamps-braly.com/jaw-contouring-ffs-and-wisdom-teeth/){.source-link}), as should you have complications when older (typically in 30s) this could affect results after removal.

If getting a tracheal shave, it can sometimes affect ability to get [VFS](#vocal-feminisation-surgery-vfs) in the future. It is worth discussing with both FFS and VFS surgeons about this. 

#### FFS Surgeons

Here is a non-exhaustive list of surgeons that are talked about sometimes. My research in this area is relatively non-exhastative so DYOR and maybe update this.

Some famous ones are DB, Keojampa, Mardirossian, Harrison Lee. See [reddit discussion on their styles](https://old.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/1c6dw4j/comment/l018xdj/){.source-link}. In Europe, QQ seems to be the current meta, some are happy with FT but doesn't seem worth the cost. There are others also I guess. I probably should write a better list some time. 

## Body Hair

There are a few main methods of hair removal:

#### Shaving

This one is obvious. Doesn't last very long

#### Waxing

Also obvious, lasts longer but non-permanent

#### Hair Removal Creams

This can lighten and thin out the hair somewhat, also temporary

#### Laser Hair Removal

This is more peramanent than other methods. It involves shining very high intensity light at your skin to damage your hair follicles with lasers.
Typical starter pack is to do ~8 sessions spaced apart by 4 weeks (though for many it takes much longer, 12-20 sessions).
Quality of results depends a lot on skin type and hair colour. Generally, dark hair + light skin works the best.

Still requires top ups after the 8 sessions.

Most find the pain tollerable / not that bad, but if you have particularly sensitive skin and find that after the session is was too unpleasant, there are things you can take to releave pain topically:

- [reddit post on anesthetic creams](https://old.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/ewhy0b/psa_if_you_do_laser_or_electrolysis_get/){.source-link}
- [reddit post on microneedling also discussing anesthetic creams](https://old.reddit.com/r/vindicta30plus/comments/1blaz1l/microneedling_a_review_and_how_do_to_that_at_home/){.source-link}

<!-- probably worth adding some more details here -->

#### Electrolysis

Most permanent method, involves actually killing the hair follicles with electricity. Most expensive and painful option. Usually one goes to a clinic, and pays in intervals of, eg, 15 minutes.
I have found a typical pace to be an average 1 hair follicle per second, so with 1000s of hair follicles on the face it can take a long time. 

There are sketchy ways to [do it DIY for cheap](http://lena.kiev.ua/guestbook/#570){.source-link} if that is your kind of thing.

Depending on your pain tolerance, you will probably want to apply either EMLA (lidocaine 5%) or AMETOP (tetracaine 4%) numbing cream, in addition to taking something like ibuprofen. It is possible to get stronger creams such as Pliaglis (7% lidocaine + 7% tetracaine) but this often requires a prescription.

## Breast Growth

#### Adifyline and Volufiline, Selective Fat Depositing

See most [sections on upcycling supplements](#weight-gain-supplements) above.

#### Stop and Go method

Some people have considered stopping estrogen temporarily, then restarting is, as a method to try to "recalibrate estrogen sensitivity".

This person tried it and it seemed to work for them: 

* [Original post on stop and go method](https://old.reddit.com/r/estrogel/comments/gqsh2g/a_practical_use_of_estrogel_as_a_topical_to/){.source-link}

* [Follow up post claiming it now endorsed by Dr. Powers](https://old.reddit.com/r/estrogel/comments/jjvwqr/looks_like_the_stopandgo_is_also_endorsed_read/){.source-link}


#### Progesterone

[Research post on Progesterone](https://papers.lgbt/papers/prog){.source-link}

> “after 6–12 months” is a reasonable default
>
> if your goal is to maximize the ductal scaffold before layering alveolar fullness, wait for budding, then consider progesterone, understanding that its volumetric benefit is unproven and may be subtle or person‑specific

### Breast Augmentation

If not getting good results naturally, or not quickly enough, it is possible to get do various kinds of breast augmentation (BA) surgery.

todo: write more here

## Voice

#### Voice Training

There are many different resources. Maybe try a few of these guides:

- Lena [Shortcut to female voice](http://lena.kiev.ua/voice/){.source-link}
- alyssavt [No explanations, just instructions! (feminizing)](https://buymeacoffee.com/alyssavt/no-explanations-instructions-feminizing){.source-link}
- TransVoiceLessons [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@TransVoiceLessons) and [BEGINNERS Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfCS01MkbIY)
- L's [Voice Training Guide (Level 1) for MTF transgender vocal feminization](https://old.reddit.com/r/transvoice/comments/d3clhe/ls_voice_training_guide_level_1_for_mtf/){.source-link}
- [Voice Training, Essentially](https://voicefem-essentially.carrd.co/){.source-link}

You can get an idea of how you are doing using the "Voice Tools" app (probably the most common app). It mostly just measures pitch though:

- [VoiceTools Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.DevExtras.VoiceTools)
- [VoiceTools iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/voice-tools/id1447495900)


### Vocal Feminisation Surgery (VFS)

If wanting permanent results with less voice training, surgery is an option. Note that recovery can be quite difficult (eg: not speaking for 2 weeks - 2 months) and in general one retains more optionality/pitch if one trains. 

In addition, one will still be required to do some amount of voice training even if you get surgery, otherwise your voice will sound somewhat unnatrual.

From people online, it seems like [Yeson Voice Center](https://us.yesonvc.com/page/2_4_1.php) in South Korea is the best place to get it done.

Here is an overview of some of the main methods.

* [ChatGPT Comparison](/sources/chatgpt_vfs.html){.source-link}


#### Cricothyroid Approximation (CTA)

CTA was the first widely used pitch-raising procedure. Outcomes with CTA are less reliable and often less natural-sounding than other methods. Many patients’ voices acquire an unnaturally high or “falsetto” quality after CTA.

#### Wendler Glottoplasty (Anterior Glottic Web Formation)

Wendler glottoplasty is performed through the mouth, no external incisions, and physically shortens the vibratory length of the vocal folds. The surgeon removes or thins the epithelium (mucosal tissue) on the anterior (front) portion of both vocal folds and then stitches the front parts of the cords together, creating a small anterior web.

This permanently reduces the length of the vibrating portion of the folds (similar to how a shorter guitar string produces a higher pitch). The reduced length and resulting increased tension cause a higher fundamental frequency when speaking.

A notable variation of this is Yeson Voice Center’s VFSRAC technique in South Korea. This is probably the most highly regarded voice center I have read about.

#### Feminization Laryngoplasty (FemLar)

Feminization laryngoplasty is a more extensive surgical approach that physically reconstructs the larynx (voice box) to a smaller, more female size. it is an open-neck surgery combined with endoscopic work on the vocal folds.

Provides a comprehensive feminization of the voice. Because it addresses pitch and resonance. It is the most invasive option and thus carries greater risks and recovery demands. patients may lose both their lowest notes and a bit of their highest, leaving a narrower range.

## Hair

### General care

See reddit tbh I ain't bothered to write it all here.

* [Reddit r/HaircareScience Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/wiki/index/)

#### Fringe

A common strategy in the MtF trans community to "improve shaping of the face" is to get a fringe. 


### Prevent loss / regain growth

#### Finasteride / Dutasteride

Decreases DHT levels to prevent hair loss (NOT an anti-androgen) and is associated with mental health effects. See other websites for this, these are common.

#### Minoxidil

Promotes hair growth. See other website for this, also quite common. (or someone else please update this)

#### Topical Estrogen (without feminization)
> try to wash your face 5 minutes after applying [5 mg/ml estriol serum]: this will only allow the shunt pathway (ie through hair follicules) maximizing the effect on follicules and therefore the pores, without allowing normal transdermal absorption
> this method is used by men using E2 to regrow hair without systemic side effects (like boobs) and is supported by papers I read (search the sub for the shunt pathway)

I haven't looked much at this. See [comment in this unrelated reddit post](https://old.reddit.com/r/estrogel/comments/1bodb0k/dont_waste_money_on_volufiline_get_the_raw/){.source-link}

### PP405

PP405, a currently-under-research compound currently in clinical trials for hair growth.

#### Hair Transplant

Todo: add more info here.

## Other chemicals

There are various other things aspects one could consider, including growth hormone and various peptides that have selective similar effects. For the most part, I haven't looked into this topic that deeply. Below are some links for those interested. Feel free to propose git pull requests on these sections.



#### IGF-1, Growth Hormone, and GHRH Agonists

Some links of possible interest:

* [igf-1 and the use of ghrh analogues in mtf breast development](https://papers.lgbt/papers/igf){.source-link}
* [GHRH analogs and their potential role as non-hormonal adjuncts for masculinization in female-to-male transsexuals](https://papers.lgbt/papers/ghrh){.source-link}

#### CJC-1295

CJC-1295 DAC, also known as DAC:GRF, is a synthetic peptide analogue of growth hormone-releasing hormone and a growth hormone secretagogue. It is a modified form of GHRH with improved pharmacokinetics, especially in regard to half-life.

- [article about it](https://allaboutpeptides.com/cjc-1295-peptide/){.source-link}
- [post about it on Reddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/DrWillPowers/comments/uh22mo/cjc1295_wdac_effect_on_breast_growth_and_surgery/){.source-link}

#### ipamorelin

Ipamorelin is a peptide selective agonist of the ghrelin/growth hormone secretagogue receptor and a growth hormone secretagogue. It is a pentapeptide with the amino acid sequence Aib-His-D-2-Nal-D-Phe-Lys-NH₂ that was derived from GHRP-1. Ipamorelin significantly increases plasma growth hormone levels in both animals and humans. In addition, ipamorelin stimulates body weight gain in animals

#### tesmorelin

Tesamorelin is a synthetic hormone used to reduce excess abdominal fat in adults with HIV-associated lipodystrophy. It is administered via subcutaneous injection and requires a prescription from a doctor.

I have seen one report of someone injecting 6/3/3mg mix of tesmorelin/cjc1295/ipamorelin vial into belly fat.

> The cjc1295, I inject into belly fat, a 6/3/3mg mix of tesmorelin/cjc1295/ipamorelin vial. A few minutes after the injection, I can feel a headrush, and any soreness recovery from exercise appears to happen within hours, however there may be soreness in the breasts from tissues expanding.

#### igf-1 DES

Des(1-3)IGF-1 is a truncated form of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) that has enhanced potency compared to IGF-1 due to its reduced binding to insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins. It is used in research and has potential therapeutic applications, particularly in growth-related conditions. Some random quote from a person online.

> I inject the igf-1 DES in the right breast area as the lymphatic system drains into the left side if I understand it correctly. The DES modification of igf-1 is very potent and activates all the growth receptors, including insulin receptors. The half life isn't very long, but the effect is noticable. About 0.05mL at a time, twice a day, from a 2mL of bacteriostatic water in a 1mg igf-1 DES vial.

(DYOR here tbh)


#### kisspeptin 

Kisspeptin stimulates production of GnRH, FSH and LH and is much cheaper than (prescription-only) injectable FSH (follitropin). Can lead to additional breast growth.

FSH seems to help with breast growth.

LH stimulates production of testosterone by testicles, so this would need to be controlled, eg, with bicalutamide.


Example dosage:
> 5mg/3ml 0.05 ml thrice a week (injections with insulin syringes with needles 8 mm into fat on thigh, buttock or arm, not abdomen)
>
> reported side effect of kisspeptin:
> - pain in abdomen (influence on intestine or colon).

### Avoiding scarring

If cut, there is potential research on avoiding scar tissue from forming.

#### Verteporfin

Unknown efficacy. Inhibits YAP/TAZ pathways. May be used to reduce scarring, but at the cost of increasing skin aging. There may one day exist other ways to induce TAP/TAZ (or downstream reduce cGAS–STING activation) that reduce sking aging.

* Research post by u/darthemofan on u/estrogel: ["Hacking YAP/TAZ mechanosensor against skin aging (in the future)"](https://old.reddit.com/r/estrogel/comments/1bpj9o2/hacking_yaptaz_mechanosensor_against_skin_aging/){.source-link}

There is some telegram community looking at it on [verteporfin.net](https://verteporfin.net/). In general it seems like it does have an effect, but various self-experimentations have given mixed results. Some notes:

* Most published info comes only from animal studies. It's FDA approved but only for a different purpose ("for treating choroidal neovascularization"). Some few people have self-tests for scarring specifically.
* You need to apply the verteporfin asap after injury, but approx within ~1 day seems maybe fine. Avoid light exposure after application.
* Dose seems to matter a lot, current consensus is ~0.8mg/cm^2 being good, too little or too much seems bad.
* Available form is Visudyne®, but there is a recipe using raw verteporfin, but the results using it were not great, but also they used a small dose. It's not water soluble so it's kinda tricky, and you would need a sonicator
* For acne scars it seems too difficult to redo the scars.
* Most tests use injectible form, but there are experimental papers on hydrogels also, maybe they work better who knows.
